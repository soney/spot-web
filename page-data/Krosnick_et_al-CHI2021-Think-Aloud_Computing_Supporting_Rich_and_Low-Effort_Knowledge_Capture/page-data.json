This makes it harder to understand why a colleague designed a component a certain way or remember requirements for software you wrote a year ago. We introduce think-aloud computing, a novel application of think-aloud where users are encouraged to speak while they work to capture rich knowledge with relatively low effort. Through a formative study encouraging think-aloud, we find people shared information about design intent, work processes, problems encountered, to-do items, and other useful information. We developed a prototype that supports think-aloud computing by prompting users to speak and contextualizing speech with labels and context. Our evaluation shows subtler design decisions and process explanations were captured in think-aloud than via traditional documentation. Participants who created slides or 3D models reported think-aloud required similar effort as traditional documentation.","award":"none","award_description":"","status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"4cbb0fbd-9638-51ac-86c7-b6a289a38de1","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/c2bd7780e65fc2d2c92aaa0c2788f5fc/think_aloud_computing_20b20cdef3.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"0161c1fe-c72e-53bb-b025-f05eac138de8","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"3277d8b0-6e33-5c80-8277-4515a989979a","given_name":"Fraser","family_name":"Anderson","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/fraser-anderson"},{"id":"fff6b997-5124-59ff-84e2-ce2b2dbdbba8","given_name":"Justin","family_name":"Matejka","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/justin-matejka"},{"id":"531f7692-0f4f-5c61-acda-4640ce28e08a","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"5ef7fa74-804c-5915-bd8b-6771f8bca976","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":null},{"id":"b4d2790c-36ec-5a01-8396-0280379b5502","given_name":"Tovi","family_name":"Grossman","homepage":"https://www.tovigrossman.com/"},{"id":"3b22e782-b787-55a6-bc37-39453bbe4bbd","given_name":"George","family_name":"Fitzmaurice","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/george-fitzmaurice"}],"venue":{"id":"032cd4ba-2c0d-54f1-a5c9-d05266679e07","year":2021,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2021","homepage":"https://chi2021.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"451fbc72-ce50-536b-aa85-dc11e99e55de"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
