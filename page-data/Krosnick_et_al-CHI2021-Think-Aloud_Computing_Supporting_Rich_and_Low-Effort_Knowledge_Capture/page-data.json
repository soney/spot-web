This makes it harder to understand why a colleague designed a component a certain way or remember requirements for software you wrote a year ago. We introduce think-aloud computing, a novel application of think-aloud where users are encouraged to speak while they work to capture rich knowledge with relatively low effort. Through a formative study encouraging think-aloud, we find people shared information about design intent, work processes, problems encountered, to-do items, and other useful information. We developed a prototype that supports think-aloud computing by prompting users to speak and contextualizing speech with labels and context. Our evaluation shows subtler design decisions and process explanations were captured in think-aloud than via traditional documentation. Participants who created slides or 3D models reported think-aloud required similar effort as traditional documentation.","award":"none","award_description":"","submission_status":null,"pdf":{"id":"4cbb0fbd-9638-51ac-86c7-b6a289a38de1","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/c2bd7780e65fc2d2c92aaa0c2788f5fc/think_aloud_computing_20b20cdef3.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"e34d1866-1a37-5003-b4d8-a2f73434dc57","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"a7e4b57c-9d0c-5a9b-9f00-98e7ca98e350","given_name":"Fraser","family_name":"Anderson","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/fraser-anderson"},{"id":"d16ba443-7074-59ec-9586-435096f9fd48","given_name":"Justin","family_name":"Matejka","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/justin-matejka"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"57ac47d8-890d-5661-b094-451acd78c740","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":null},{"id":"7653bfd1-3c14-5612-9486-22ef092a7920","given_name":"Tovi","family_name":"Grossman","homepage":"https://www.tovigrossman.com/"},{"id":"82531a65-d7b8-52bf-9d7c-723b36dfca1b","given_name":"George","family_name":"Fitzmaurice","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/george-fitzmaurice"}],"venue":{"id":"1a75822f-a333-55a7-8bc1-02010309e874","year":2021,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2021","homepage":"https://chi2021.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d14ddade-ba7e-5c43-9d61-c0b4ad654cc0"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
