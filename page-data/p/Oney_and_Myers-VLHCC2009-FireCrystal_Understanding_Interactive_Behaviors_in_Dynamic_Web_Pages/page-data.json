FireCrystal is a new Firefox extension that allows developers  to  indicate interactive  behaviors  of interest, and shows the specific code (Javascript, CSS, and HTML)  that  is  responsible for those behaviors. FireCrystal  provides an execution timeline that  users can scrub back and forth, and the ability to select items of interest in the actual web page UI to see the associated code. FireCrystal may be especially useful for developers who are trying to learn the implementation details of interactive behaviors, so they can reuse these behaviors in their own web site.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/56d476db462a80bbd99013613d3c0369.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/spot-web/static/56d476db462a80bbd99013613d3c0369-a37fe7ff6922368401916f859444901d.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":9,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"}],"venue_year":{"id":1,"year":2009,"venue":2,"homepage":"http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/vlhcc09/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_1"}}}
