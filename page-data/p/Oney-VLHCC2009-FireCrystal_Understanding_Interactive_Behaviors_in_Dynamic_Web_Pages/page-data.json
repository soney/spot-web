FireCrystal  is  a new Firefox  extension  that allows developers  to  indicate interactive  behaviors  of interest, and shows the specific code (Javascript, CSS, and  HTML)  that  is  responsible  for  those  behaviors. FireCrystal  provides  an  execution  timeline that  users can scrub back and forth, and the ability to select items of  interest  in  the  actual  web  page  UI  to  see  the associated  code.  FireCrystal  may  be  especially  useful for    developers    who    are    trying    to    learn    the implementation details of interactive behaviors, so they can reuse these behaviors in their own web site.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/b04f114d017a11bdafab36e6930b7fdb.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/b04f114d017a11bdafab36e6930b7fdb-a37fe7ff6922368401916f859444901d.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":9,"given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"}],"venue_year":{"id":1,"year":2009,"venue":2}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_1","fname":"Oney-VLHCC2009-FireCrystal_Understanding_Interactive_Behaviors_in_Dynamic_Web_Pages","venue_short_name":"VL/HCC"}}}
