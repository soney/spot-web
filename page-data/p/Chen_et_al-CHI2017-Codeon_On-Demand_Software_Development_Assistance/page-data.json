Existing technologies  for  synchronous communication  (e.g.  voice  chat)have high scheduling costs, and asynchronous communication tools (e.g. forums) require developers to carefully de-scribe their code context to yield useful responses. This paper introduces Codeon, a system that enables more effective task hand-off  between  end-user  developers  and  remote  helpers by allowing asynchronous responses to on-demand requests.With Codeon, developers can request help by speaking their requests aloud within the context of their IDE. Codeon automatically captures the relevant code context and allows re-mote  helpers  to  respond  with  high-level  descriptions,  code annotations,  code  snippets, and  natural  language  explanations. Developers can then immediately view and integrate these  responses  into  their  code. In this paper,  we  describe Codeon, the studies that guided its design,  and our evaluation that its effectiveness as a support tool. In our evaluation,developers  using  Codeon  completed  nearly  twice  as  many tasks  as  those  who  used  state-of-the-art  synchronous  video and code sharing tools, by reducing the coordination costs of seeking assistance from other developers.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/3f1613053954398f4d2dd8fba2552428.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/3f1613053954398f4d2dd8fba2552428-e9b00045a1f7f4e1348c5e37c3fb92fe.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":8,"membership":"member","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":31,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Sang Won","family_name":"Lee","homepage":"https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/"},{"id":32,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Yin","family_name":"Xie","homepage":null},{"id":33,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"YiWei","family_name":"Yang","homepage":null},{"id":26,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":8,"year":2017,"venue":1,"homepage":"https://chi2017.acm.org/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_11"}}}
