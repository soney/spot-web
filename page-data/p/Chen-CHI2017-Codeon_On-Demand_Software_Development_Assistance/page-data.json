Existing tech-nologies  for  synchronous  communication  (e.g.   voice  chat)have high scheduling costs,  and asynchronous communica-tion tools (e.g.   forums) require developers to carefully de-scribe their code context to yield useful responses. This paperintroduces Codeon, a system that enables more effective taskhand-off  between  end-user  developers  and  remote  helpersby allowingasynchronousresponses to on-demand requests.With Codeon, developers can request help by speaking theirrequests aloud within the context of theirIDE.   Codeon au-tomatically captures the relevant code context and allows re-mote  helpers  to  respond  with  high-level  descriptions,  codeannotations,  code  snippets,  and  natural  language  explana-tions.  Developers can then immediately view and integratethese  responses  into  their  code.   In  this  paper,  we  describeCodeon,  the studies that guided its design,  and our evalua-tion that its effectiveness as a support tool. In our evaluation,developers  using  Codeon  completed  nearly  twice  as  manytasks  as  those  who  used  state-of-the-art  synchronous  videoand code sharing tools, by reducing the coordination costs ofseeking assistance from other developers.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/3f1613053954398f4d2dd8fba2552428.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/3f1613053954398f4d2dd8fba2552428-e9b00045a1f7f4e1348c5e37c3fb92fe.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":8,"given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":31,"given_name":"Sang Won","family_name":"Lee","homepage":"https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/"},{"id":32,"given_name":"Yin","family_name":"Xie","homepage":null},{"id":33,"given_name":"YiWei","family_name":"Yang","homepage":null},{"id":26,"given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":8,"year":2017,"venue":1}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_11","fname":"Chen-CHI2017-Codeon_On-Demand_Software_Development_Assistance","venue_short_name":"CHI"}}}
