In this paper, we introduce  programming  primitives  that  enable  program-mers  to  implement  multi-touch  gestures  in  a  more  under-standable way by helping them build these abstractions. Our design of these primitives was guided by a formative study, in which we observed developers’ natural implementations of custom gestures. Touch groupsprovide summaries of mul-tiple fingers rather  than  requiring that  programmers track them manually. Cross eventsallow programmers to summa-rize the movement of one or a group of fingers. We imple-mented these two primitives in two environments: a declar-ativeprogramming  system  and  in  a  standard  imperative programming language. We found that these primitives are capable of defining nuanced multi-touch gestures, which we illustrate through a series of examples. Further, in two user evaluations of these programming primitives, we found that multi-touch behaviors implemented in these programming primitives   are   more   understandable   than   those   imple-mented with standard touch events.","award":"honorable_mention","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/a180f09ce8f508036d4ce0faf23c53df.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/a180f09ce8f508036d4ce0faf23c53df-595fc79372acf758b31b07e6522e3ff0.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":16,"given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"},{"id":9,"given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"},{"id":7,"given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"}],"venue_year":{"id":9,"year":2019,"venue":1}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_16","fname":"Oney-CHI2019-Implementing_Multi-Touch_Gestures_with_Touch_Groups_and_Cross_Events","venue_short_name":"CHI"}}}
