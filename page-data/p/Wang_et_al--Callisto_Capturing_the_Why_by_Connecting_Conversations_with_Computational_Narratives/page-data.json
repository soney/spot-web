These discussions not only explain analysis in the current notebooks but also alternative paths, which are often poorly documented. However, these discussions are disconnected from the notebooks for which they could provide valuable context. We propose Callisto, an extension to computational notebooks that captures and stores contextual links between discussion messages and notebook elements with minimal effort from users. Callisto allows notebook readers to better understand the current notebook content and the overall problem-solving process that led to it, by making it possible to browse the discussions and code history relevant to any part of the notebook. This is particularly helpful for onboarding new notebook collaborators to avoid misinterpretations and duplicated work, as we found in a two-stage evaluation with 32 data science students.","award":"honorable_mention","pdf":null,"authors":[{"id":4,"membership":"member","given_name":"April","family_name":"Wang","homepage":"https://aprilwang.me/"},{"id":45,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Zihan","family_name":"Wu","homepage":null},{"id":42,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue":{"id":17,"year":2020,"short_name":"CHI","homepage":"https://chi2020.acm.org/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"full_name":"International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UISTzh","type":null},{"id":"Venue_7","strapiId":7,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_8","strapiId":8,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_9","strapiId":9,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_10","strapiId":10,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_11","strapiId":11,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_12","strapiId":12,"full_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_13","strapiId":13,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_14","strapiId":14,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_15","strapiId":15,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_16","strapiId":16,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_17","strapiId":17,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_18","strapiId":18,"full_name":"The ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences","short_name":"IMX","type":null},{"id":"Venue_19","strapiId":19,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":"conference"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_19"}}}
