However,  ultra-small computing platforms like the Sony  SmartWatch and Apple  iPod Nano lack a means of text entry. This limits their potential, despite the fact they are capable computers. In this work, we present a soft  keyboard  interaction  technique  called ZoomBoard  that  enables  text  entry  on  ultra-small devices. Our approach uses  iterative  zooming  to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comfortable size. We based our design on a QWERTY layout, so that it is immediately familiar  to users and leverages  existing skill. As the ultimate test, we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16x6mm–smaller than a US penny. After eight practice trials, users  achieved  an average of 9.3 words  per  minute,  with accuracy comparable to a full-sized physical keyboard. This compares favorably to existing mobile text input methods.","award":"honorable_mention","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/45e116dcaf2278f8bef72b5362198d06.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/spot-web/static/45e116dcaf2278f8bef72b5362198d06-2406afe7976a760c93ea004ceaeb9def.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":22,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Chris","family_name":"Harrison","homepage":"http://www.chrisharrison.net/"},{"id":23,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Amy","family_name":"Ogan","homepage":"http://amyogan.com/"},{"id":24,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Jason","family_name":"Wiese","homepage":"http://jasonwiese.net/"}],"venue_year":{"id":6,"year":2013,"venue":1,"homepage":"https://chi2013.acm.org/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_7"}}}
