Immersive  au-thoring   tools   propose   to   reduce   the   learning   curve   of   VRprogramming  by  allowing  users  to  create  VR  content  whileimmersed  in  VR.  Immersive  authoring  can  take  advantage  ofmany  of  the  features  that  make  VR  applications  intuitive  andnatural  to  use—users  can  manipulate  programming  primitivesthrough direct manipulation, immediately see the output of theircode,  and  use  their  innate  spatial  reasoning  capabilities  whenviewing a program. In this paper, we investigate the benefits andchallenges of immersive dataflow authoring. We implemented animmersive authoring tool that enables dataflow programming inVR  and  conducted  a  series  of  retrospective  interviews.  We  alsodescribe design implications for future immersive authoring tools.","award":"best_paper","pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/d7da7c340c5510c13dac52cf5166edf7.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/d7da7c340c5510c13dac52cf5166edf7-139e411571c51dfa6691af4f0c265211.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":5,"given_name":"Lei","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"http://raynezhang.me/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":14,"year":2019,"venue":2}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_17","fname":"Zhang-VLHCC2019-Studying_the_Benefits_and_Challenges_of_Immersive_Dataflow_Programming","venue_short_name":"VL/HCC"}}}
