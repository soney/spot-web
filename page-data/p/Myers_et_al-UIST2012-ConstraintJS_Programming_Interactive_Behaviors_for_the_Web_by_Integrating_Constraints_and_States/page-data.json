These  constraints  maintain  relation-ships amongobjects,  control  the  graphical  layout,  and  link the user interfaceto anunderlying data model. However, no existing Web  implementation  technology  provides  direct support  for  all  of  these,  so  the code for  maintaining con-straints and tracking state may end up spread across multiple languages  and  libraries. In  this  paper  we  describe  Con-straintJS, a system that integrates constraintsand finite-statemachines  (FSMs)  with  Web  languages.A  key  role  for  the FSMs  is  toenable  and disableconstraintsbased on the inter-face’s  current  mode,  making  it  possible  to  write  constraints that sometimeshold. We illustratethat constraints combined with FSMs can be a clearer way of defining many interactive behaviorswith a series of examples.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/096049d484157d44289c3f1c166c9d78.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/096049d484157d44289c3f1c166c9d78-ca0972db09a2e3d9646ef827eb357965.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":9,"given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":16,"given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"}],"venue_year":{"id":17,"year":2012,"venue":3,"homepage":"https://uist.acm.org/uist2012/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_6"}}}
