However,even  with  such  documents,  developers  often  overlook  somedocuments  and  build  software  systems  that  are  inconsistentwith   the   legal   usage   of   those   libraries.   Existing   softwareverification  tools  require  formal  specifications  (such  as  codecontracts), and therefore cannot directly verify the legal usagedescribed  in  natural  language  text  in  API  documents  againstcode  using  that  library.  However,  in  practice,  most  librariesdo  not  come  with  formal  specifications,  thus  hindering  tool-based  verification.  To  address  this  issue,  we  propose  a  novelapproach to infer formal specifications from natural languagetext  of  API  documents.  Our  evaluation  results  show  that  ourapproach  achieves  an  average  of  92%  precision  and  93%recall in identifying sentences that describe code contracts frommore than 2500 sentences of API documents. Furthermore, ourresults show that our approach has an average 83% accuracyin inferring specifications from over 1600 sentences describingcode  contracts.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/2eeb8211935368620b0b7766c3a77538.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/2eeb8211935368620b0b7766c3a77538-5cb0dfc594ed9ae276977b400477882e.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":17,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Rahul","family_name":"Pandita","homepage":null},{"id":20,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Tao","family_name":"Xie","homepage":"http://taoxie.cs.illinois.edu/"},{"id":19,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Hao","family_name":"Zhong","homepage":null},{"id":18,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Xusheng","family_name":"Xiao","homepage":null},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":21,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Amit","family_name":"Paradkar","homepage":null}],"venue_year":{"id":5,"year":2012,"venue":5,"homepage":"https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/icseweb/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_5"}}}
