InterStaterepresentsinteractive  behaviors clearly and concisely using a combinationofnovel forms ofstate machinesand constraints.  It  also  introduces  new  lan-guage features that allow programmers to easily modularize and  reuse  behaviors.  InterState  uses  a new visual  notation that  allows  programmers  to  better  understand  and  navigate their  code.  InterState  also  includes  a liveeditor  that  imme-diately   updates   the   running   application   in   response   to changes  in  the  editor  and  vice  versa  to  help  programmers understand the state of their program. Finally, InterState caninterface withcode and widgets written in other languages, for  exampletocreate  a  user  interface  in InterState  that communicates  with  a  database.We  evaluated  the  under-standability  of  InterState’s  programming  primitives  in  a comparative laboratory  study.We found  that  participants weretwice  as  fastat  understanding  and  modifying GUIcomponents when  theywere implemented  withInterState than whenthey were implemented ina conventionaltextual event-callback style.  We  evaluated  InterState’s  scalability with  a  series  of  benchmarks  and  example  applications  and found  that  it  can  scale  to  implement  complex behaviors involvingthousands of objects and constraints.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/56c56da2a8b1ae3cad7b06e595598d66.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/56c56da2a8b1ae3cad7b06e595598d66-d9a66db397b58e6e978c767d98dca326.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":9,"given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"},{"id":16,"given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"}],"venue_year":{"id":10,"year":2014,"venue":3}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_8","fname":"Oney-UIST2014-InterState_A_Language_and_Environment_for_Expressing_Interface_Behavior","venue_short_name":"UIST"}}}
