However, communicating about code canbe difficult, particularly in asynchronous settings where one user writes an explanation for another user to readand understand later on. Communicating about code is uniquely difficult for two reasons. First, code-relatedexplanations are dichotomous, containing fragments of code and associated natural language descriptionsthat are not necessarily sequential. Second, instructions’ explanations of code often involve multiple stages ofmodifying code in steps throughout their explanation, but these intermediate steps are difficult to capture. Thispaper introduces chat.codes, a new tool for creating guided explanations about code, meant to be consumedasynchronously. chat.codes introduces three features that make it easier to communicate about code. First,it introduces deictic code references, which allow users to reference specific region of code in parts of theirexplanations. Second, it tracks and summarizes code edits in-line with messages, allowing users to createexplanations in stages. Third, it tracks every version of code, enabling future users to back-track to previousversion of code to reconstruct the context for code references. An evaluation showed that these features werebeneficial for both instructors and students in an introductory programming course.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/b87c03b0b4a14fa0f3460e785f66e491.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/b87c03b0b4a14fa0f3460e785f66e491-c1f6176d3d869e56b6b33ee36c7fa0ad.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":42,"given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/"},{"id":43,"given_name":"Paul","family_name":"Resnick","homepage":"http://presnick.people.si.umich.edu/"}],"venue_year":{"id":13,"year":2018,"venue":4,"homepage":"https://cscw.acm.org/2018/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_15"}}}
