Existing technologies  for  synchronous communication  (e.g.  voice chat) have high scheduling costs, and asynchronous communication tools (e.g. forums) require developers to carefully describe their code context to yield useful responses. This paper introduces Codeon, a system that enables more effective task hand-off  between end-user developers and remote helpers by allowing asynchronous responses to on-demand requests. With Codeon, developers can request help by speaking their requests aloud within the context of their IDE. Codeon automatically captures the relevant code context and allows remote helpers to respond with high-level descriptions, code annotations, code snippets, and  natural  language explanations. Developers can then immediately view and integrate these  responses  into  their  code. In this paper, we describe Codeon, the studies that guided its design,  and our evaluation that its effectiveness as a support tool. In our evaluation,developers using Codeon completed  nearly twice as many tasks as those who used state-of-the-art synchronous video and code sharing tools, by reducing the coordination costs of seeking assistance from other developers.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/3f1613053954398f4d2dd8fba2552428.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/3f1613053954398f4d2dd8fba2552428-e9b00045a1f7f4e1348c5e37c3fb92fe.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":8,"membership":"member","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":31,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Sang Won","family_name":"Lee","homepage":"https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/"},{"id":32,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Yin","family_name":"Xie","homepage":null},{"id":33,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"YiWei","family_name":"Yang","homepage":null},{"id":26,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue":{"id":9,"year":2017,"short_name":"CHI","homepage":"https://chi2017.acm.org/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"full_name":"International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UISTzh","type":null},{"id":"Venue_7","strapiId":7,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_8","strapiId":8,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_9","strapiId":9,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_10","strapiId":10,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_11","strapiId":11,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_12","strapiId":12,"full_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_13","strapiId":13,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_14","strapiId":14,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_15","strapiId":15,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_16","strapiId":16,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_17","strapiId":17,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_18","strapiId":18,"full_name":"The ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences","short_name":"IMX","type":null},{"id":"Venue_19","strapiId":19,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":"conference"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_11"}}}
