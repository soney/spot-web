In-stead, developers resort to finding answers through online search engines and systems such as Stack Overflow. However, the process of finding and integrating a working solution is often very time-consuming. Though code search engines have increased in quality, there remain significant language-and workflow-gaps in meeting end-user needs. Novice and intermediate programmers often lack the “language” to query, and the expertise in transferring found code to their task. To address this problem, we present CodeMend, a system to support finding and integration of code. CodeMend leverages a neural embedding model to jointly model natural language and code as mined from large Web and code datasets. We also demonstrate a novel, mixed-initiative, interface to support query and integration steps. Through CodeMend, end-users describe their goal in natural language. The system makes salient the relevant API functions, the lines in the end-user’s program that should be changed, as well as proposing the actual change. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of CodeMend through lab and simulation studies.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/2eaf9ca91875f9aa15a6124c1f948320.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/2eaf9ca91875f9aa15a6124c1f948320-504186adabf96d1c6388cd874661b373.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":27,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Xin","family_name":"Rong","homepage":null},{"id":28,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Shiyan","family_name":"Yan","homepage":null},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":29,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Mira","family_name":"Dontcheva","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/mira-dontcheva/"},{"id":30,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Eytan","family_name":"Adar","homepage":"http://www.cond.org/"}],"venue_year":{"id":18,"year":2016,"venue":3,"homepage":"https://uist.acm.org/uist2016/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_10"}}}
