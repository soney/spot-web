In practice, developers often seek support fromIDEtools, Web resources, or other developers to help fill in gapsin their knowledge on-demand. In this paper, we present twostudies that seek to inform the design of future systems thatuse  remote  experts  to  support  developers  on  demand.   Thefirst explores what types of questions developers would ask ahypothetical assistant capable of answering any question theypose. The second study explores the interactions between de-velopers and remote “experts” in supporting roles. Our resultssuggest eight key system features needed for on-demand re-mote developer assistants to be effective, which has implica-tions for future human-powered development tools.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/23438cb3c044ee581214ef0b2ed3d96f.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/23438cb3c044ee581214ef0b2ed3d96f-fcaf994d08ae9982e356f64adfc0402f.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":8,"given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":26,"given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"}],"venue_year":{"id":7,"year":2016,"venue":1}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_9","fname":"Chen-CHI2016-Towards_Providing_On-Demand_Expert_Support_for_Software_Developers","venue_short_name":"CHI"}}}
