Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenientinteractive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination ofcode, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing incomputational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individualnotebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experiencewith collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 datascientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working oneither notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting.The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a sharedcontext, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronousediting features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination.The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations.Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborativeediting in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.","award":"best_paper","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/251de42ea0895e4d2b45dc89a41e2507.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/251de42ea0895e4d2b45dc89a41e2507-82a708205d764fa923be907183f773d4.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":4,"given_name":"April","family_name":"Wang","homepage":"https://aprilwang.me/"},{"id":44,"given_name":"Anant","family_name":"Mittal","homepage":""},{"id":42,"given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":15,"year":2019,"venue":4}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_18","fname":"Wang-CSCW2019-How_Data_Scientists_Use_Computational_Notebooks_for_Real-Time_Collaboration","venue_short_name":"CSCW"}}}
