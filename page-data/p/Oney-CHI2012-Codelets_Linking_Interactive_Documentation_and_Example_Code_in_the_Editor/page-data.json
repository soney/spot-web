These examples couple the concrete functionality of code  with  rich  contextual information  about how the code works. However, using these examples necessitates understanding, configuring, and integrating the code, all of which typically take place after the example enters the user’s code and has been removed from its original instructive context. In  short, a  user’s interaction  with  an  example continues  well  after  the  code  is  pasted. This paper investigates  whether  treating  examples  as  “first-class” objects  in the code editor—rather  than  simply  as  strings  of  text—will  allow  programmers  to  use  examples  more  effectively.We  explore  this  through  the  creation  and  evaluation  of Codelets. A Codelet is  presented  inline  with the  user’s code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive  helper  widget that  assists the  user in understanding and  integrating  the  example. The Codelet persists  through-out the example’s lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20  participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43%  faster when  using  Codelets  than  when  using  a standard Web browser.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/0ce6018a0b736481a913917e2e06dd0c.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/0ce6018a0b736481a913917e2e06dd0c-6c74c74883144f64e92d67634e84652a.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":16,"given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"}],"venue_year":{"id":4,"year":2012,"venue":1}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_4","fname":"Oney-CHI2012-Codelets_Linking_Interactive_Documentation_and_Example_Code_in_the_Editor","venue_short_name":"CHI"}}}
