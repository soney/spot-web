To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design workshops. In the first  workshop, focused on conceiving, we observed  that designers want to invent controls by exploring  gestures, context, and examples.  In  the  second workshop, on refining and  communicating,  designers proposed tools  that could refine  movement, document context through usage  scenarios, and support the use of examples. In this workshop they struggled to effectively communicate their ideas for developers because  their ideas had not been fully  explored. In  reflecting on this struggle, we began to see an  opportunity for the output of a design tool  to  be a boundary object that would allow for an ongoing conversation between the design and the material of software, in which the developer acts as a mediator for software.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/6207ae103830028735ef1be8ce7bba73.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/6207ae103830028735ef1be8ce7bba73-5c3ff868cb443c661335723d95cfc9e4.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":11,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Kursat","family_name":"Ozenc","homepage":"http://kursatozenc.com/"},{"id":9,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"},{"id":12,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Miso","family_name":"Kim","homepage":null},{"id":10,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"John","family_name":"Zimmerman","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnz/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":2,"year":2010,"venue":1,"homepage":"http://www.chi2010.org/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_2"}}}
