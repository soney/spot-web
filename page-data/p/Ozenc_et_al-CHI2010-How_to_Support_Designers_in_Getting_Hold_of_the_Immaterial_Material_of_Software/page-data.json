To inves-tigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design workshops.  In  the  first  workshop,  focused  on conceiving, we  observed  that  designers  want  to  invent  controls  by  ex-ploring  gestures,  context,  and  examples.  In  the  second workshop,  on refining and  communicating,  designers  pro-posed  tools  that  could  refine  movement, document  context through  usage  scenarios,  and  support  the  use  of  examples. In this workshop they struggled to effectively communicate their  ideas  for  developers  because  their  ideas  had  not  been fully  explored.  In  reflecting  on  this  struggle,  we  began  to see  an  opportunity  for  the  output  of  a design  tool  to  be  a boundary object that would allow for an ongoing conversa-tion  between  the  design  and  the  material  of  software,  in which the developer acts as a mediator for software.
