However,  ultra-small  compu-ting platforms  likethe Sony  SmartWatchand  Apple  iPod Nano lack ameans of text entry. This limits their potential, despite the fact they are capable computers. In this work, we present  a  soft  keyboard  interaction  technique  called  Zoom-Board  that  enables  text  entry  on  ultra-small  devices. Our approach uses  iterative  zooming  to enlargeotherwise  im-possibly tiny keys to comfortable size. We based our design on  a QWERTYlayout,so  that itis  immediately  familiar  to users  and  leverages  existing skill.  As  the  ultimate  test,  we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16x 6mm–smaller than a USpenny. After eight practice trials, users  achieved  an  average  of  9.3  words  per  minute,  with accuracy comparable to a full-sized physical keyboard. Thiscompares favorably to existingmobile text input methods.","award":"honorable_mention","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/45e116dcaf2278f8bef72b5362198d06.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/45e116dcaf2278f8bef72b5362198d06-2406afe7976a760c93ea004ceaeb9def.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":22,"given_name":"Chris","family_name":"Harrison","homepage":"http://www.chrisharrison.net/"},{"id":23,"given_name":"Amy","family_name":"Ogan","homepage":"http://amyogan.com/"},{"id":24,"given_name":"Jason","family_name":"Wiese","homepage":"http://jasonwiese.net/"}],"venue_year":{"id":6,"year":2013,"venue":1}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_7","fname":"Oney-CHI2013-ZoomBoard_A_Diminutive_QWERTY_Soft_Keyboard_Using_Iterative_Zooming_for_Ultra-Small_Devices","venue_short_name":"CHI"}}}
