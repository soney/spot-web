However, existing interface prototyping  and  creation tools do not effectively let designers explore, compare, or keep track of older  versions of interface mockups, implicitly making the  assumption that the users of these tools will work with one design alternative at a time. To explore how to enable designers to work with multiple designs in a prototyping tool, we created Playbook, a  new system oriented  towards helping interface designers  keep  track  of, compare, and create interactive mockups. In this paper, we describe Playbook and discuss ways that future prototyping tools can better support the workflow of designers.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/0bc9ce07c34b36411cb9140333561c11.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/0bc9ce07c34b36411cb9140333561c11-6e7e363951b4b78783c080bb413bda81.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":14,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Tessa","family_name":"Lau","homepage":"http://tlau.org/"},{"id":13,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"John","family_name":"Barton","homepage":null},{"id":15,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Jeffrey","family_name":"Nichols","homepage":"http://www.jeffreynichols.com/"},{"id":9,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"}],"venue_year":{"id":3,"year":2011,"venue":6,"homepage":"http://iseud11.di.uniba.it/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_3"}}}
