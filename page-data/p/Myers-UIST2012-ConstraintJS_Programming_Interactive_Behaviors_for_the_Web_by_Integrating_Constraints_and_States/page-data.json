These  constraints  maintain  relation-ships amongobjects,  control  the  graphical  layout,  and  link the user interfaceto anunderlying data model. However, no existing Web  implementation  technology  provides  direct support  for  all  of  these,  so  the code for  maintaining con-straints and tracking state may end up spread across multiple languages  and  libraries. In  this  paper  we  describe  Con-straintJS, a system that integrates constraintsand finite-statemachines  (FSMs)  with  Web  languages.A  key  role  for  the FSMs  is  toenable  and disableconstraintsbased on the inter-face’s  current  mode,  making  it  possible  to  write  constraints that sometimeshold. We illustratethat constraints combined with FSMs can be a clearer way of defining many interactive behaviorswith a series of examples.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/096049d484157d44289c3f1c166c9d78.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/096049d484157d44289c3f1c166c9d78-ca0972db09a2e3d9646ef827eb357965.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":9,"given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":16,"given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"}],"venue_year":{"id":17,"year":2012,"venue":3}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_6","fname":"Myers-UIST2012-ConstraintJS_Programming_Interactive_Behaviors_for_the_Web_by_Integrating_Constraints_and_States","venue_short_name":"UIST"}}}
