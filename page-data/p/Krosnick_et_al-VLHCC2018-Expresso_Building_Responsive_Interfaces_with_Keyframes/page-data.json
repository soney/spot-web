To  define responsive  pages,  developers  must  use  Cascading  Style  Sheets (CSS)  or  libraries  and  tools  built  on  top  of  it. CSS provides high  customizability,  but  requires  significant  experience.  As  a result, non-programmers and novice programmers generally lack a  means of  easily building  custom responsive  web  pages. In  this paper,  we  present  a  new  approach  that  allows  users  to  create custom responsive user interfaces without writing program code. We  demonstrate  the  feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  the  approach through a new system we built, named Expresso. With Expresso, users define “keyframes”—examples of how their UI should look for  particular  viewport  sizes  —  by  simply  directly  manipulating elements  in  a WYSIWYG editor.  Expresso  uses  these  keyframes to  infer  rules  about  the  responsive  behavior  of  elements,  and automatically  renders  the  appropriate CSS for  a  given  viewport size. To allow users to create the desired appearance of their page at all viewport sizes, Expresso lets users define either a “smooth” or  “jump”  transition  between  adjacent  keyframes.  We  conduct a  user  study  and  show  that  participants  are  able  to  effectively use  Expresso  to  build  realistic  responsive  interfaces.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/87c952c13704391bb61e568978802c42.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/87c952c13704391bb61e568978802c42-82a2cdd53c483d7c694eff64a0b5d334.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":7,"given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":26,"given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":31,"given_name":"Sang Won","family_name":"Lee","homepage":"https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":11,"year":2018,"venue":2,"homepage":"https://vlhcc18.github.io/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_12"}}}
