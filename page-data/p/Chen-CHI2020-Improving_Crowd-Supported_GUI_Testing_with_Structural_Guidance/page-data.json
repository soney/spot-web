It is often easier and faster\nthan a dedicated quality assurance team, and its output is more\nrealistic than that of automated testing. However, crowds of\ntesters working in parallel tend to focus on a small set of\ncommonly-used User Interface ( UI ) navigation paths, which\ncan lead to low test coverage and redundant effort. In this\npaper, we introduce two techniques to increase crowd testers’\ncoverage: interactive event-flow graphs and GUI -level guid-\nance. The interactive event-flow graphs tracks and aggregates\nevery tester’s interactions into a single directed graph that\nvisualizes the cases that have already been explored. Crowd\ntesters can interact with the graphs to find new navigation\npaths and increase the coverage of the created tests. We also\nuse the graphs to augment the GUI ( GUI -level guidance) to help\ntesters avoid only exploring common paths. Our evaluation\nwith 30 crowd testers on 11 different test pages shows that the\ntechniques can help testers avoid redundant effort while also\nincreasing untrained testers’ coverage by 55%. These tech-\nniques can help us develop more robust software that works\nin more mission-critical settings not only by performing more\nthorough testing with the same effort that has been put in be-\nfore, but also by integrating them into different parts of the\ndevelopment pipeline to make more reliable software in the\nearly development stage.","award":null,"pdf":null,"authors":[{"id":8,"given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":6,"given_name":"Mauli","family_name":"Pandey","homepage":"https://pandeymauli.github.io/research/"},{"id":48,"given_name":"Jean","family_name":"Song","homepage":"https://jyskwon.github.io/"},{"id":26,"given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"}],"venue_year":{"id":16,"year":2020,"venue":1}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_20","fname":"Chen-CHI2020-Improving_Crowd-Supported_GUI_Testing_with_Structural_Guidance","venue_short_name":"CHI"}}}
