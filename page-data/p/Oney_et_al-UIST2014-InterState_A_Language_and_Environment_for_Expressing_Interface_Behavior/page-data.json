InterState represents interactive  behaviors clearly and concisely using a combination of novel forms of state machines and constraints.  It  also  introduces new language features that allow programmers to easily modularize and  reuse  behaviors. InterState uses  a new visual  notation that  allows  programmers to better understand and navigate their code. InterState also includes a live editor that immediately updates the running application in response to changes in the editor and vice versa to help programmers understand the state of their program. Finally, InterState can interface with code and widgets written in other languages, for example to create a user interface in InterState that communicates with a database. We evaluated the understandability of InterState’s programming primitives in a comparative laboratory study. We found  that participants were twice as fast at understanding and  modifying GUI components when they were implemented  with InterState than when they were implemented in a conventional textual event-callback style. We  evaluated  InterState’s scalability with a series  of  benchmarks and example applications and found  that it can scale to implement  complex behaviors involving thousands of objects and constraints.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/56c56da2a8b1ae3cad7b06e595598d66.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/56c56da2a8b1ae3cad7b06e595598d66-d9a66db397b58e6e978c767d98dca326.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":9,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"},{"id":16,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"}],"venue_year":{"id":10,"year":2014,"venue":3,"homepage":"https://uist.acm.org/uist2014/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"long_name":"The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"long_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"long_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"long_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"long_name":"The International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_8"}}}
