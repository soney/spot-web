Platforms that seek tight editorial control employ people to do this curation, but this process involves time-consuming routine tasks, such as sifting through thousands of videos. We introduce Sifter, a system that improves the curation process by combining automated techniques with a human-powered two-stage pipeline that browses, selects, and reaches an agreement. We evaluated Sifter by creating 12 compilations from over 34,000 user-generated videos. Sifter was more than three times faster than dedicated curators, and its output was of comparable quality. We reflect on the challenges and opportunities introduced by Sifter to inform the design of content curation systems that need subjective human judgments of videos at scale.","award":"none","pdf":null,"authors":[{"id":8,"membership":"member","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":26,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":50,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Ian","family_name":"Wehrman","homepage":null},{"id":51,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Rajan","family_name":"Vaish","homepage":null},{"id":49,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Andrés","family_name":"Monroy-Hernández","homepage":"http://www.andresmh.com/"}],"venue":{"id":18,"year":2020,"short_name":"IMX","homepage":"https://imx.acm.org/2020/"}},"allStrapiVenue":{"nodes":[{"id":"Venue_1","strapiId":1,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_2","strapiId":2,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_3","strapiId":3,"full_name":"International Symposium on End-User Development","short_name":"IS-EUD","type":null},{"id":"Venue_4","strapiId":4,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_5","strapiId":5,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_6","strapiId":6,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UISTzh","type":null},{"id":"Venue_7","strapiId":7,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_8","strapiId":8,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_9","strapiId":9,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_10","strapiId":10,"full_name":"The ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology","short_name":"UIST","type":null},{"id":"Venue_11","strapiId":11,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_12","strapiId":12,"full_name":"The International Conference on Software Engineering","short_name":"ICSE","type":null},{"id":"Venue_13","strapiId":13,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_14","strapiId":14,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_15","strapiId":15,"full_name":"IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing","short_name":"VL/HCC","type":null},{"id":"Venue_16","strapiId":16,"full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","short_name":"CSCW","type":"journal"},{"id":"Venue_17","strapiId":17,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":null},{"id":"Venue_18","strapiId":18,"full_name":"The ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences","short_name":"IMX","type":null},{"id":"Venue_19","strapiId":19,"full_name":"The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","short_name":"CHI","type":"conference"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_22"}}}
