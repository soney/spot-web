However,existing  interface  prototyping  and  creation  tools  do  not  effectively let  designersexplore,  compare,  or  keep  track  of  older  versions  of  interface mockups,  implicitly  making the  assumption  that  the  users  of  these  tools  will work with one design alternative at a time. To explore how to enable design-ers to work with multiple designs in a prototyping tool, we created Playbook, a  new  system  oriented  towards  helping interfacedesigners  keep  track  of, compare, and create interactive mockups. In this paper, we describe Playbook and discuss ways that future prototyping tools can better support the workflow of designers.","award":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/0bc9ce07c34b36411cb9140333561c11.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/0bc9ce07c34b36411cb9140333561c11-6e7e363951b4b78783c080bb413bda81.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":14,"given_name":"Tessa","family_name":"Lau","homepage":"http://tlau.org/"},{"id":13,"given_name":"John","family_name":"Barton","homepage":null},{"id":15,"given_name":"Jeffrey","family_name":"Nichols","homepage":"http://www.jeffreynichols.com/"},{"id":9,"given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"}],"venue_year":{"id":3,"year":2011,"venue":6}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Publication_3","fname":"Oney-IS-EUD2011-Playbook_Revision_Control__Comparison_for_Interactive_Mockups","venue_short_name":"IS-EUD"}}}
