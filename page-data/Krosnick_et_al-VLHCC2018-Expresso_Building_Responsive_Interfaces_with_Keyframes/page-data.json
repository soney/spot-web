To  define responsive  pages,  developers  must  use  Cascading  Style  Sheets (CSS) or libraries and tools built  on  top of it. CSS provides high customizability, but requires significant experience. As a result, non-programmers and novice programmers generally lack a means of easily building custom responsive web pages. In  this paper, we  present a new approach that allows users to create custom responsive user interfaces without writing program code. We demonstrate the  feasibility  and  effectiveness of the approach through a new system we built, named Expresso. With Expresso, users define “keyframes”—examples of how their UI should look for particular viewport  sizes—by simply directly manipulating elements  in  a WYSIWYG editor. Expresso uses these keyframes to infer  rules about the responsive  behavior  of  elements,  and automatically renders the appropriate CSS for a given  viewport size. To allow users to create the desired appearance of their page at all viewport sizes, Expresso lets users define either a “smooth” or “jump”  transition between  adjacent keyframes. We conduct a user study and show  that  participants are able to effectively use Expresso to build realistic responsive interfaces.","award":null,"award_description":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/f9f5e949edef7adc5792da4f35d11254.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/82a2cdd53c483d7c694eff64a0b5d334/f9f5e949edef7adc5792da4f35d11254.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":7,"membership":"member","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":31,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Sang Won","family_name":"Lee","homepage":"https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/"},{"id":26,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":11,"year":2018,"short_name":"VL/HCC","homepage":"https://vlhcc18.github.io/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_12"}}}
