To  define responsive  pages,  developers  must  use  Cascading  Style  Sheets (CSS) or libraries and tools built  on  top of it. CSS provides high customizability, but requires significant experience. As a result, non-programmers and novice programmers generally lack a means of easily building custom responsive web pages. In  this paper, we  present a new approach that allows users to create custom responsive user interfaces without writing program code. We demonstrate the  feasibility  and  effectiveness of the approach through a new system we built, named Expresso. With Expresso, users define “keyframes”—examples of how their UI should look for particular viewport  sizes—by simply directly manipulating elements  in  a WYSIWYG editor. Expresso uses these keyframes to infer  rules about the responsive  behavior  of  elements,  and automatically renders the appropriate CSS for a given  viewport size. To allow users to create the desired appearance of their page at all viewport sizes, Expresso lets users define either a “smooth” or “jump”  transition between  adjacent keyframes. We conduct a user study and show that participants are able to effectively use Expresso to build realistic responsive interfaces.","award":"none","award_description":"","submission_status":null,"pdf":{"id":"e1f44971-3ba4-5c2b-83e2-b02996f5e31c","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/82a2cdd53c483d7c694eff64a0b5d334/expresso_e0af1ea51a.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"e34d1866-1a37-5003-b4d8-a2f73434dc57","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"668dec02-13c6-51e6-a945-a5f617acf3a8","given_name":"Sang Won","family_name":"Lee","homepage":"https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/"},{"id":"57ac47d8-890d-5661-b094-451acd78c740","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":null},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"41d6a454-517f-513d-9540-d66ef7b46ae4","year":2018,"short_name":"VL/HCC","name_year":"VL/HCC 2018","homepage":"https://vlhcc18.github.io/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7662a6c1-cf43-5e06-9328-bb3c37ba0b4b"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
