However, identifying class-wide patterns and mistakes in students' code can be challenging, especially for large classes. Conventional code search tools are insufficient for this purpose as they are not designed for finding semantic structures underlying large students' code corpus, where the code samples are similar, relatively small, and written by novice programmers. To address this limitation, we introduce RunEx, a novel code search tool where instructors can effortlessly generate queries with minimal prior knowledge of code search and rapidly search through a large code corpus. The tool consists of two parts: 1) a syntax that augments regular expressions with runtime values, and 2) a user interface that enables instructors to construct runtime and syntax-based queries with high expressiveness and apply combined filters to code examples. Our comparison experiment shows that RunEx outperforms baseline systems with text matching alone in identifying code patterns with higher accuracy. Furthermore, RunEx features a user interface that requires minimal prior knowledge to create search queries. Through searching and analyzing students' code with runtime values at scale, our work introduces a new paradigm for understanding patterns and errors in programming education.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"9a3a3f7e-8404-5b4b-ba90-e7dddc97bff4","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/dbaae30940b60addb67914a0cf61f215/Run_Exp_VLHCC_2023_386558a2d3.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"68b63621-df9d-5cb0-aba2-16d3d65db66a","given_name":"Ashley","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"https://gezhangrp.com/"},{"id":"0ccf1926-eee7-5584-8c00-a9bb8c4498b9","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"db5bb0ac-f6fb-5a6f-b514-e36852f87611","year":2023,"short_name":"VL/HCC","name_year":"VL/HCC 2023","homepage":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2023"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"42bf7bc8-331f-5b53-bb5f-e350fecf7faa"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
