Developers use automation libraries such as Selenium to write custom web automation scripts, but this comes with challenges. A developer must identify robust navigation and element selection logic that works across a variety of user inputs and website pages.\n\nChoosing meaningful and robust CSS selectors to query the appropriate UI elements from the DOM can be particularly challenging. We believe developers need better tools for understanding the effects their script has on a website. We built a prototype web automation IDE that embeds UI snapshots and provides live feedback on CSS selectors, and presents these across different scenarios so the programmer can assess script robustness. We plan to demo our prototype to get feedback and to discuss the challenges and opportunities of UI automation.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/f80a84d8a7a3a2eb8a9f7636789b3455.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/87dd3f0cbe075e025619111a89d09638/f80a84d8a7a3a2eb8a9f7636789b3455.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":7,"membership":"member","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":41,"year":2021,"short_name":"VL/HCC","homepage":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2021"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_47"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
