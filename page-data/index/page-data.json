However, computer programming is often prohibitively difficult to learn or do correctly. Many programming languages and tools were designed around the needs and limitations of the computers executing code, which can lead to design features that are counterintuitive for the people who use those tools.\n\nWe are a research group at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), primarily in the [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/).
