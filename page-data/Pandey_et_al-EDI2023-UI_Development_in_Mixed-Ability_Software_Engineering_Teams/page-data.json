We conducted two qualitative studies to better understand the strategies that mixed-ability teams — specifically teams where some team members identify as having a visual impairment and some do not — use to collaborate on user interface (UI) development. The consistent growth of UI developer job roles has made many programmers seek UI engineering jobs. It is important to better understand the accessibility of the profession and identify ways to make it more inclusive. In this chapter, we report on the challenges in tool usage, programming practices, and communication that programmers with visual impairments encounter in the specific application area of interactive UI programming as they collaborate with their colleagues. We conclude with recommendations for building more inclusive software engineering teams by fostering communication and help-seeking interactions and we derive implications for UI frameworks that aim to support accessible application development.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":null,"authors":[{"id":"ae084eaa-80e9-5ae3-a452-2b2a9601728d","given_name":"Mauli","family_name":"Pandey","homepage":"https://pandeymauli.github.io/research/"},{"id":"f783ee48-ffe6-5d77-be2f-32dc68e08f71","given_name":"Sharvari","family_name":"Bondre","homepage":"https://shara.page/"},{"id":"a1bbffe8-58e0-558a-91e3-a3d3e46240b1","given_name":"Vaishnav","family_name":"Kameswaran","homepage":"http://vaikam.people.si.umich.edu/"},{"id":"288d3cb2-e300-592c-8bf0-5ef59e59be5f","given_name":"Hrishikesh","family_name":"Rao","homepage":"https://hrishirao.com/"},{"id":"b9d6934a-630c-5088-8645-71fbb0ac2d8e","given_name":"Sile","family_name":"O'Modhrain","homepage":"http://www.somodhrain.com/"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"3761702e-4cd3-5332-8a1c-afcf0342bf10","year":2023,"short_name":"EDI","name_year":"EDI 2023","homepage":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bc0208f6-6b43-5591-ad0d-1b04733ca111"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
