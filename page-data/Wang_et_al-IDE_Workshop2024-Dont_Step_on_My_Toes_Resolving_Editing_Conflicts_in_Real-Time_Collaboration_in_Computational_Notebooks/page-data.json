However, working together through synchronous editing of notebooks introduces new challenges. Data scientists may inadvertently interfere with each others' work by altering the shared codebase and runtime state if they do not set up a social protocol for working together and monitoring their collaborators' progress. In this paper, we propose a real-time collaborative editing model for resolving conflict edits in computational notebooks that introduces three levels of edit protection to help collaborators avoid introducing errors to both the program source code and changes to the runtime state.
