With the growing complexity and interdisciplinary of the data science field, data science workers must embrace effective collaboration to improve the quality and efficiency of the work. My work aims to understand different collaboration needs and challenges around data science, and design better programming tools to support collaborative data science.\n\nApril received her B.Eng. in Computer Science from Zhejiang University and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University, where my master thesis investigated non-programmers learning computational literacy.

Working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination.","authors":[{"id":4,"given_name":"April","family_name":"Wang","membership":"member","homepage":"https://aprilwang.me/"},{"id":44,"given_name":"Anant","family_name":"Mittal","membership":"collaborator","homepage":""},{"id":42,"given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","membership":"collaborator","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","membership":"lead","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue":{"id":16,"location":"Austin, TX, USA","year":2019,"homepage":"https://cscw.acm.org/2019/","conference_start":"11/9","conference_end":"11/13","short_name":"CSCW"}},{"id":"Publication_19","title":"Callisto: Capturing the \"Why\" by Connecting Conversations with Computational Narratives","award":"honorable_mention","award_description":null,"pub_details":"(to appear)","short_description":"We designed Callisto, a Jupyter Notebook extension for better explaining messy notebooks.
