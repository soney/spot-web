With the growing complexity and interdisciplinary of the data science field, data science workers must embrace effective collaboration to improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Her work aims to understand different collaboration needs and challenges around data science, and design better programming tools to support collaborative data science. April received her B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), where her Masters thesis investigated non-programmers learning computational literacy.","membership":"member","links":[{"id":8,"url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yitS6coAAAAJ&hl=en","description":"Google Scholar"},{"id":7,"url":"https://github.com/LittleAprilFool","description":"Github"},{"id":9,"url":"https://twitter.com/AprilWang95","description":"Twitter"}],"media":[],"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/54ad488fdd64dac4a46366c7c2d57355/9842e/d7d7c8d9ea120986469ce00df28c9f8f.jpg","srcSet":"/static/54ad488fdd64dac4a46366c7c2d57355/07ab6/d7d7c8d9ea120986469ce00df28c9f8f.jpg 225w,\n/static/54ad488fdd64dac4a46366c7c2d57355/32fd5/d7d7c8d9ea120986469ce00df28c9f8f.jpg 450w,\n/static/54ad488fdd64dac4a46366c7c2d57355/9842e/d7d7c8d9ea120986469ce00df28c9f8f.jpg 900w,\n/static/54ad488fdd64dac4a46366c7c2d57355/ccd76/d7d7c8d9ea120986469ce00df28c9f8f.jpg 958w","sizes":"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Author_4","pubs":[{"id":"Publication_18","title":"How Data Scientists Use Computational Notebooks for Real-Time Collaboration","award":"best_paper","award_description":null,"pub_details":"Volume 3, Article No. 39","short_description":"We reported how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks through a formative survey and an observational study. Working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination.","status":"accepted","authors":[{"id":4,"given_name":"April","family_name":"Wang","membership":"member","homepage":"https://aprilwang.me/"},{"id":44,"given_name":"Anant","family_name":"Mittal","membership":"collaborator","homepage":""},{"id":42,"given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","membership":"collaborator","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","membership":"lead","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":16,"location":"Austin, TX, USA","year":2019,"type":"journal","homepage":"https://cscw.acm.org/2019/","conference_start":"11/9","conference_end":"11/13","short_name":"CSCW"}},{"id":"Publication_19","title":"Callisto: Capturing the \"Why\" by Connecting Conversations with Computational Narratives","award":"honorable_mention","award_description":null,"pub_details":"(to appear)","short_description":"We designed Callisto, a Jupyter Notebook extension for better explaining messy notebooks.
