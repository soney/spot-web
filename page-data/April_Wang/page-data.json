Her broad research area is human-computer interaction (HCI), with a focus on enabling and encouraging collaborations for exploratory programming. My recent project involves improving computational notebook infrastructure (e.g., support real-time group collaboration, facilitate joint discourse over shared context) to better support collaborative data science.\n\nApril received her B.Eng. in Computer Science from Zhejiang University and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Simon Fraser University, where my master thesis investigated non-programmers learning computational literacy.
