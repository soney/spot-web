We propose a new end-user specification model – asking the end-user to explicitly identify parts of their natural language query that can be generalized. We built a PBD system, ParamMacros, where users first generalize a concrete natural language question – identifying parameters and their possible values – and then create a demonstration of how to answer the question on the website of interest. ParamMacros then infers a generalized program by using the user-provided parameter values to identify relevant patterns in the website’s structure. In a lab study we found that participants were able to meaningfully parameterize natural language queries and felt such a parameterization and demonstration process would be useful for creating custom automation.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"6ac2d522-9ffc-513c-bfdd-c54c9766bfa7","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/07143b7e51a4bd8391e8de65e5a6581f/parammacros_a344f5e751.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"e34d1866-1a37-5003-b4d8-a2f73434dc57","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"78db54fa-c5c9-5f94-a620-b831a5fcdd60","year":2022,"short_name":"VL/HCC","name_year":"VL/HCC 2022","homepage":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2022"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8facd46c-fcac-5def-84cb-314724aac277"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
