We propose a new end-user specification model – asking the end-user to explicitly identify parts of their natural language query that can be generalized. We built a PBD system, ParamMacros, where users first generalize a concrete natural language question – identifying parameters and their possible values – and then create a demonstration of how to answer the question on the website of interest. ParamMacros then infers a generalized program by using the user-provided parameter values to identify relevant patterns in the website’s structure. In a lab study we found that participants were able to meaningfully parameterize natural language queries and felt such a parameterization and demonstration process would be useful for creating custom automation.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/2a57f3fc66fa3f99d23f95ee4c226de4.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/72d25bbc906b8603fdb2f1cdbe279047/2a57f3fc66fa3f99d23f95ee4c226de4.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":7,"membership":"member","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":43,"year":2022,"short_name":"VL/HCC","homepage":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2022"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_49"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
