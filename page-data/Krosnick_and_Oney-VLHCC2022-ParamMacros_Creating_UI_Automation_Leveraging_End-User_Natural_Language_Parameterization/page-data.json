We propose a new end-user specification model – asking the end-user to explicitly identify parts of their natural language query that can be generalized. We built a PBD system, ParamMacros, where users first generalize a concrete natural language question – identifying parameters and their possible values – and then create a demonstration of how to answer the question on the website of interest. ParamMacros then infers a generalized program by using the user-provided parameter values to identify relevant patterns in the website’s structure. In a lab study we found that participants were able to meaningfully parameterize natural language queries and felt such a parameterization and demonstration process would be useful for creating custom automation.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"16ad0808-b658-5d9a-84ae-8789019e5133","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/72d25bbc906b8603fdb2f1cdbe279047/parammacros_6cb6f5f7e5.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"0161c1fe-c72e-53bb-b025-f05eac138de8","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"531f7692-0f4f-5c61-acda-4640ce28e08a","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"38ce8b22-1c9f-5bc6-9cc2-21068a4868ed","year":2022,"short_name":"VL/HCC","name_year":"VL/HCC 2022","homepage":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2022"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0c23e8c9-f349-540c-a6c5-aad6baa432a0"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
