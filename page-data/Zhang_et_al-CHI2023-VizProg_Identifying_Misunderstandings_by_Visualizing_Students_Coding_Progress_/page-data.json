However, as we found in interviews with programming instructors, monitoring students' progress during exercises is difficult, particularly for large classes. We present VizProg, a system that allows instructors to monitor and inspect students' coding progress in real-time during in-class exercises. VizProg represents students' statuses as a 2D Euclidean spatial map that encodes the students' problem-solving approaches and progress in real-time. VizProg allows instructors to navigate the temporal and structural evolution of students' code, understand relationships between code, and determine when to provide feedback. A comparison experiment showed that VizProg helped to identify more students' problems than a baseline system. VizProg also provides richer and more comprehensive information for identifying important student behavior. By managing students' activities at scale, this work presents a new paradigm for improving the quality of live learning.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"d2ea6a7c-3f8c-5b22-9bd2-c02998f9ad9e","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/fb597834d009e60f5994b0991c6d533d/chi23b_sub1516_cam_i16_6c90ec9599.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"7ca90384-83d5-5de2-bc18-905cf01dbf4b","given_name":"Ashley","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"https://gezhangrp.com/"},{"id":"6e76ce81-8198-53b9-81c0-7d1499c77305","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":"531f7692-0f4f-5c61-acda-4640ce28e08a","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"9955771c-6a56-5493-b37a-a2c042e75a7a","year":2023,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2023","homepage":"https://chi2023.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6eb993f0-edbd-5fb0-a332-beec95027e3b"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
