However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination.","status":"accepted","authors":[{"id":4,"given_name":"April","family_name":"Wang","homepage":"https://aprilwang.me/","membership":"member","use_local_homepage":null},{"id":44,"given_name":"Anant","family_name":"Mittal","homepage":"","membership":"collaborator","use_local_homepage":null},{"id":42,"given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/","membership":"collaborator","use_local_homepage":null},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney","membership":"lead","use_local_homepage":true}],"venue":{"id":16,"location":"Austin, TX, USA","year":2019,"homepage":"https://cscw.acm.org/2019/","conference_start":"11/9","conference_end":"11/13","short_name":"CSCW","full_name":"The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing","type":"journal"},"pdf":{"publicURL":"/static/82a708205d764fa923be907183f773d4/1a05b8bb72e8a6cd53a2c66066adcd20.pdf"}},{"id":"Publication_19","strapiId":19,"title":"Callisto: Capturing the \"Why\" by Connecting Conversations with Computational Narratives","award":"honorable_mention","award_description":null,"pub_details":"(to appear)","short_description":"We designed Callisto, a Jupyter Notebook extension for better explaining messy notebooks.
