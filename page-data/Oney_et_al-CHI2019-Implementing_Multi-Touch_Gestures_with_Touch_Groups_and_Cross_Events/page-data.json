In this paper, we introduce  programming  primitives  that  enable  programmers to implement  multi-touch  gestures  in  a  more  understandable way by helping them build these abstractions. Our design of these primitives was guided by a formative study, in which we observed developers’ natural implementations of custom gestures. Touch groups provide summaries of multiple fingers rather  than  requiring that  programmers track them manually. Cross events allow programmers to summarize the movement of one or a group of fingers. We implemented these two primitives in two environments: a declarative programming  system  and in a standard imperative programming language. We found that these primitives are capable of defining nuanced multi-touch gestures, which we illustrate through a series of examples. Further, in two user evaluations of these programming primitives, we found that multi-touch behaviors implemented in these programming primitives  are  more understandable than those implemented with standard touch events.","award":"honorable_mention","award_description":"","status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"a1b8bc34-c305-580c-9027-e392b38d31e6","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/595fc79372acf758b31b07e6522e3ff0/implementing_multitouch_gestures_with_touch_groups_and_cross_events_9d006274fc.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"531f7692-0f4f-5c61-acda-4640ce28e08a","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"0161c1fe-c72e-53bb-b025-f05eac138de8","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"4395c0b3-e1f9-5312-a789-66bf99f1da48","given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"},{"id":"c4a18cad-f129-5051-a6f6-8efbcc7aa247","given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"}],"venue":{"id":"1960d263-4070-550e-a680-9b25b7edfe78","year":2019,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2019","homepage":"http://chi2019.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"113af5db-62a9-571d-9427-9dbe2d70c381"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
