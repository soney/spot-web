While web automation offers potential benefits by streamlining tasks and addressing accessibility barriers, it also introduces unique challenges due to the complexities of automating interactions with interfaces designed for humans. Beyond technical advancements, addressing these challenges requires meeting human-centric needs and concerns surrounding web automation. In this paper, we explore critical questions about users’ web automation needs and preferences through a series of interviews with a diverse group of participants, including individuals across various age ranges and users with visual impairments. Our findings offer insights on how users weigh concerns such as privacy, error rates, efficiency, and usefulness in deciding what level of automation might be appropriate for a given task. We highlight critical areas for improvement inautomation tools and design principles for future systems.","award":"none","award_description":null,"submission_status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"752a400d-e4e4-5c47-801c-52dc7ffb655f","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/0ddf127af4a8ae82e29c67cf94e9fb89/Understanding_Challenges_and_Needs_of_Using_AI_in_Web_Automation_Systems_d0301309a2.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"b45e1ceb-2ff8-5fba-b3dd-8cb6bb675e9e","given_name":"Jiacheng","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"https://susan-zjc.github.io/"},{"id":"c1b4edb6-37b9-5c16-af6c-8aa382fd97bb","given_name":"Carl","family_name":"Fan","homepage":null},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"53e860db-dbcb-5e28-b7e7-468b065892ef","year":2025,"short_name":"CHI2025-CompUI","name_year":"CHI 2025 Computational UI Workshop","homepage":"https://sites.google.com/view/computational-uichi25"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ce362c67-617b-5e8c-ba0d-6b6e53111628"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
