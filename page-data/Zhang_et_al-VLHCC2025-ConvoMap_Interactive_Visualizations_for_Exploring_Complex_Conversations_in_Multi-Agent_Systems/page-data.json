In MASs, multiple autonomous agents with predetermined roles collaborate by dividing responsibilities. However, MAS developers often struggle to understand and diagnose agents' behavior from thousands of inter-agent messages across multiple complex conversations. To identify key requirements and challenges related to evaluating, debugging, and managing MASs, we conducted a formative study with six MAS developers. We then introduce ConvoMap, a prototype that addresses a key challenge of MAS development---understanding agents' behaviors across multiple conversations. ConvoMap integrates automated qualitative coding to enable multi-level inspection of agents' behavior. ConvoMap can then visualize hundreds of MAS conversations by representing messages as points on a 2D map that encode their semantic meanings and interactions between agents. To better support navigation and deeper analysis, ConvoMap provides topic overviews and highlights relevant text segments. A comparison study showed that ConvoMap helped to understand agents' behavior more accurately than the baseline.","award":"none","award_description":null,"submission_status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"afa4f829-f4b0-59f9-bed2-80bf58d425bd","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/0200a493c09967cc4a09634dca1b4086/convomap_a1af435f23.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"68b63621-df9d-5cb0-aba2-16d3d65db66a","given_name":"Ashley","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"https://gezhangrp.com/"},{"id":"aa4de906-55f8-5da6-925e-09d19033294c","given_name":"Victor","family_name":"Bursztyn","homepage":null},{"id":"73ee76c0-b752-5fe4-a474-435ae23c4fdb","given_name":"Gromit","family_name":"Chan","homepage":null},{"id":"0d25c503-3c15-5f8b-b32e-a89b409e8524","given_name":"Shunan","family_name":"Guo","homepage":null},{"id":"c163b7ca-ac03-56a4-961e-e0892c99d502","given_name":"Eunyee","family_name":"Koh","homepage":null},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"6c7110fa-3bf8-583f-a98d-1d85f588ad01","given_name":"Jane","family_name":"Hoffswell","homepage":null}],"venue":{"id":"fd5e0c09-3d9f-51e6-8821-495dfe816c41","year":2025,"short_name":"VL/HCC","name_year":"VL/HCC 2025","homepage":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/vlhcc-2025"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d43e1951-3fbf-5953-bc41-fefbf2b34254"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
