In-stead, developers resort to finding answers through online search engines and systems such as Stack Overflow. However, the process of finding and integrating a working solution is often very time-consuming. Though code search engines have increased in quality, there remain significant language-and workflow-gaps in meeting end-user needs. Novice and intermediate programmers often lack the “language” to query, and the expertise in transferring found code to their task. To address this problem, we present CodeMend, a system to support finding and integration of code. CodeMend leverages a neural embedding model to jointly model natural language and code as mined from large Web and code datasets. We also demonstrate a novel, mixed-initiative, interface to support query and integration steps. Through CodeMend, end-users describe their goal in natural language. The system makes salient the relevant API functions, the lines in the end-user’s program that should be changed, as well as proposing the actual change. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of CodeMend through lab and simulation studies.","award":null,"award_description":null,"pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/8fca98e58160443ac9d61fc74f5ae8b9.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/504186adabf96d1c6388cd874661b373/8fca98e58160443ac9d61fc74f5ae8b9.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":27,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Xin","family_name":"Rong","homepage":null},{"id":28,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Shiyan","family_name":"Yan","homepage":null},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":29,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Mira","family_name":"Dontcheva","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/mira-dontcheva/"},{"id":30,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Eytan","family_name":"Adar","homepage":"http://www.cond.org/"}],"venue":{"id":8,"year":2016,"short_name":"UIST","homepage":"http://uist.acm.org/uist2016/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_10"}}}
