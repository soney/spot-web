In-stead, developers resort to finding answers through online search engines and systems such as Stack Overflow. However, the process of finding and integrating a working solution is often very time-consuming. Though code search engines have increased in quality, there remain significant language-and workflow-gaps in meeting end-user needs. Novice and intermediate programmers often lack the “language” to query, and the expertise in transferring found code to their task. To address this problem, we present CodeMend, a system to support finding and integration of code. CodeMend leverages a neural embedding model to jointly model natural language and code as mined from large Web and code datasets. We also demonstrate a novel, mixed-initiative, interface to support query and integration steps. Through CodeMend, end-users describe their goal in natural language. The system makes salient the relevant API functions, the lines in the end-user’s program that should be changed, as well as proposing the actual change. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of CodeMend through lab and simulation studies.","award":"none","award_description":"","status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"e4d60d7f-e514-57fe-86ec-3b6904077884","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/504186adabf96d1c6388cd874661b373/codemend_9b04987287.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"f4d7cf56-93fe-55ed-8012-8f7b4d169861","given_name":"Xin","family_name":"Rong","homepage":null},{"id":"73316d8e-9a2c-59a4-9193-4eefbfd0efac","given_name":"Shiyan","family_name":"Yan","homepage":null},{"id":"531f7692-0f4f-5c61-acda-4640ce28e08a","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"6946c78e-0ba7-5235-acbf-06a4bee010b3","given_name":"Mira","family_name":"Dontcheva","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/mira-dontcheva/"},{"id":"49a307d3-bdaf-5a39-b428-0f1f8a4f2fbd","given_name":"Eytan","family_name":"Adar","homepage":"http://www.cond.org/"}],"venue":{"id":"d0f9018d-3b48-58b2-a7f6-ad937e0a3ddb","year":2016,"short_name":"UIST","name_year":"UIST 2016","homepage":"http://uist.acm.org/uist2016/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3e6959c3-4ea2-529c-8334-5f100d89f1f3"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
