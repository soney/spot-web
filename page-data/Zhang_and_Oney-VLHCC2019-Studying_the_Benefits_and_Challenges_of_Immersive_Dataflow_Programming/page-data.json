Immersive  authoring tools  propose to reduce the learning curve of VR programming by allowing users to create  VR content  while immersed in VR. Immersive  authoring  can take advantage  of many of the features that make VR applications intuitive and natural to use—users can manipulate programming  primitives through direct manipulation, immediately see the output of their code, and use their innate spatial reasoning  capabilities  when viewing a program. In this paper, we investigate the benefits and challenges of immersive dataflow authoring. We implemented an immersive authoring tool that enables dataflow programming in VR and conducted a series  of  retrospective interviews. We also describe design implications for future immersive authoring tools.","award":"best_paper","award_description":"Best Short Paper","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/e87674e8e71a9b347f273bca9d0be525.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/139e411571c51dfa6691af4f0c265211/e87674e8e71a9b347f273bca9d0be525.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":5,"membership":"member","given_name":"Lei","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"http://raynezhang.me/"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":15,"year":2019,"short_name":"VL/HCC","homepage":"https://human-se.github.io/vlhcc2019/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_17"}}}
