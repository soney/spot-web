This makes it harder to understand why a colleague designed a component a certain way or remember requirements for software you wrote a year ago. We introduce think-aloud computing, a novel application of think-aloud where users are encouraged to speak while they work to capture rich knowledge with relatively low effort. Through a formative study encouraging think-aloud, we find people shared information about design intent, work processes, problems encountered, to-do items, and other useful information. We developed a prototype that supports think-aloud computing by prompting users to speak and contextualizing speech with labels and context. Our evaluation shows subtler design decisions and process explanations were captured in think-aloud than via traditional documentation. Participants who created slides or 3D models reported think-aloud required similar effort as traditional documentation.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/6b477c13bd2efb24e122334348f45a25.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/75fd2cd42bf2dc7530fa6ab48459ed78/6b477c13bd2efb24e122334348f45a25.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":7,"membership":"member","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":63,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Fraser","family_name":"Anderson","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/fraser-anderson"},{"id":64,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Justin","family_name":"Matejka","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/justin-matejka"},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":26,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"},{"id":65,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Tovi","family_name":"Grossman","homepage":"https://www.tovigrossman.com/"},{"id":66,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"George","family_name":"Fitzmaurice","homepage":"https://www.autodesk.com/research/people/george-fitzmaurice"}],"venue":{"id":37,"year":2021,"short_name":"CHI","homepage":"https://chi2021.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_43"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
