However, computer programming is often prohibitively difficult to learn or do correctly. Many programming languages and tools were designed around the needs and limitations of the computers executing code, which can lead to design features that are counterintuitive for the people who use those tools.\n\nWe are a research group at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), primarily in the [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/). Our research focuses on understanding the factors that make programming tools usable and designing & building new tools for programmers.","joining":"We are always excited to work with motivated and talented students.\n\n**Ph.D.**\n\nIf you are interestested in joining our research group, you should [apply to the UMSI PhD program](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/phd-information/how-do-i-apply).
