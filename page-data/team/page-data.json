However, computer programming is often prohibitively difficult to learn or do correctly. Many programming languages and tools were designed around the needs and limitations of the computers executing code, which can lead to design features that are counterintuitive for the people who use those tools.\n\nWe are a research group at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), primarily in the [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/). Our research focuses on understanding the factors that make programming tools usable and designing & building new tools for programmers.","joining":"We are always excited to work with motivated and talented students.\n\n**Prospective Ph.D. Students**\n\nIf you are interestested in joining our research group, you should [apply to the UMSI PhD program](https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/phd-information/how-do-i-apply). We strongly recommend reaching out to at least one member of the research group before you apply.\n\n**Prospective Masters and Undergraduate Students**\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating with our research group, please reach out to [soney@umich.edu](mailto:soney@umich.edu). You should ideally include your resume and a brief description of your interests.\n\n**Recommended Skills**\n\nWe are particularly interested in collaborators who have experience with (or are interested in learning):\n\n- Technical Skills\n  - Many of our projects involve prototyping and building interactive interfaces in order to evaluate their usability, feasibility, etc.  \n  - We often use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build and explore\n  - A strong mathematics background is a plus\n- Qualitative Research Methods\n- Design and Design Principles\n\n"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
