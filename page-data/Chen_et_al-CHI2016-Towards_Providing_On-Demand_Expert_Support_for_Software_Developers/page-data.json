In practice, developers often seek support from IDE tools, Web resources, or other developers to help fill in gaps in their knowledge on-demand. In this paper, we present two studies that seek to inform the design of future systems that use  remote  experts  to  support  developers  on  demand. The first explores what types of questions developers would ask a hypothetical assistant capable of answering any question they pose. The second study explores the interactions between developers and remote “experts” in supporting roles. Our results suggest eight key system features needed for on-demand re-mote developer assistants to be effective, which has implications for future human-powered development tools.","award":"none","award_description":"","status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"1b0d0035-238f-5718-92da-03908f80eb03","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/fcaf994d08ae9982e356f64adfc0402f/towards_ondemand_support_e5db25bc47.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"0ccf1926-eee7-5584-8c00-a9bb8c4498b9","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"57ac47d8-890d-5661-b094-451acd78c740","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":null}],"venue":{"id":"00ee8217-acb3-5930-a974-48d42563e691","year":2016,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2016","homepage":"https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9b602bf0-282d-58e5-ba85-ffeeb3abf6ac"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
