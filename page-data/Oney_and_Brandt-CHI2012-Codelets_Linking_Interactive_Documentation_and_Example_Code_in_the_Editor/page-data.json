These examples couple the concrete functionality of code  with  rich  contextual information  about how the code works. However, using these examples necessitates understanding, configuring, and integrating the code, all of which typically take place after the example enters the user’s code and has been removed from its original instructive context. In short, a user’s interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating  examples  as  “first-class” objects in the code editor—rather than simply  as strings of text—will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation  and  evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented  inline with the user’s code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating  the  example. The Codelet persists through-out the example’s lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20  participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43%  faster when  using  Codelets than when using a standard Web browser.","award":"none","award_description":"","submission_status":null,"pdf":{"id":"02320072-f0f7-5504-a2a1-f8a3c16eee06","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/6c74c74883144f64e92d67634e84652a/codelets_c55f5f7e93.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"0746ef61-0b5a-5cd1-9c4e-cfffd901751a","given_name":"Joel","family_name":"Brandt","homepage":"https://research.adobe.com/person/joel-brandt/"}],"venue":{"id":"2f889308-8fd7-5443-9499-4b937846bc34","year":2012,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2012","homepage":"http://chi2012.acm.org/index.shtml"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8f2fded6-e6e0-52f9-804f-d55b4bce144e"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
