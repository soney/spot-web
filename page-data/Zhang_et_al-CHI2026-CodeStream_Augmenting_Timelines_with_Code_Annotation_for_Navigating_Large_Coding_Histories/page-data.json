For example, a correct solution may contain large copy-and-pasted segments (suggesting the code originated elsewhere) or unguided trial-and-error (suggesting a lack of clear strategy). Timelines are a common way to visualize code histories, but existing timeline visualizations of code or document histories show only when and where edits occurred, not what changed. Without this context, it is difficult to answer key questions about how students invested effort or to infer their intentions. We present CodeStream, a visualization system that augments timelines with situational code annotations, whose granularity and visibility dynamically adapt to scale and interaction state. A comparison study shows that CodeStream enables context-aware navigation of coding histories, supporting fast and accurate pattern identification, and helping instructors reason about students' coding behaviors and identify who may need intervention.","award":"none","award_description":null,"submission_status":"accepted","pdf":null,"authors":[{"id":"68b63621-df9d-5cb0-aba2-16d3d65db66a","given_name":"Ashley","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"https://gezhangrp.com/"},{"id":"1def3613-ac49-53af-90d4-30f8502e9bbf","given_name":"Yan-Ru","family_name":"Jhou","homepage":null},{"id":"21c4afb2-242a-553e-91d6-68ebf19b1a7d","given_name":"Yinuo","family_name":"Yang","homepage":null},{"id":"bab5eaef-42f6-502d-b97e-50ebeba28b75","given_name":"Shamita","family_name":"Rao","homepage":null},{"id":"a4570d7c-9522-5312-a5b7-c74f249f3074","given_name":"Maryam","family_name":"Arab","homepage":"https://sites.google.com/view/maryamarab/home"},{"id":"0ccf1926-eee7-5584-8c00-a9bb8c4498b9","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"ff27d0b5-64d5-586c-bda6-a2dcd74bd72f","year":2026,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2026","homepage":"https://chi2026.acm.org"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c2746ea2-6f33-5cb8-bef8-2efc51c3a079"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
