Recently, he doing research in immersive authoring in Virtual Reality to enable users to easily create 3D interactive contents. I am constantly thinking about this fascinating question: how do we shape the languages (programming languages, body languages, natural languages, etc.) that people will use to customize and communicate with the holograms in the future?\n\nPreviously, he was an undergraduate in the School of Software at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I was a research member at the Digital ART Lab of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Xubo Yang and Prof. Shuangjiu Xiao. He has also conducted research at Cascade Lab in University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, supervised by Prof. Wai-Tat Fu.","membership":"member","links":[{"id":10,"url":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jmobsnwAAAAJ&hl=en","description":"Google Scholar"},{"id":11,"url":"https://github.com/RayneZhang/","description":"Github"},{"id":12,"url":"https://twitter.com/_RayneZ","description":"Twitter"},{"id":13,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/itsraynez/","description":"Instagram"}],"media":[],"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"aspectRatio":0.8963855421686747,"src":"/static/649b976aebeab3a115b861fef6272eb3/4d2f6/ed11d81251cfb7bdfcdef71a999f7e10.jpg","srcSet":"/static/649b976aebeab3a115b861fef6272eb3/ac08b/ed11d81251cfb7bdfcdef71a999f7e10.jpg 225w,\n/static/649b976aebeab3a115b861fef6272eb3/3643e/ed11d81251cfb7bdfcdef71a999f7e10.jpg 450w,\n/static/649b976aebeab3a115b861fef6272eb3/4d2f6/ed11d81251cfb7bdfcdef71a999f7e10.jpg 900w,\n/static/649b976aebeab3a115b861fef6272eb3/5c830/ed11d81251cfb7bdfcdef71a999f7e10.jpg 1116w","sizes":"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"Author_5","pubs":[{"id":"Publication_17","title":"Studying the Benefits and Challenges of Immersive Dataflow Programming","award":"best_paper","award_description":"Best Short Paper","pub_details":"pp 223-227","short_description":null,"authors":[{"id":5,"given_name":"Lei","family_name":"Zhang","membership":"member","homepage":"http://raynezhang.me/"},{"id":1,"given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","membership":"lead","homepage":"http://from.so/"}],"venue_year":{"id":14,"location":"Memphis, TN, USA","venue":2,"year":2019,"homepage":"https://human-se.github.io/vlhcc2019/","conference_start":"2019-10-12","conference_end":"2019-10-16"}}]}}}
