Lei's research interests lie primarily in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Authoring Tools, and 3D User Interfaces. Recently, he doing research in immersive authoring in Virtual Reality to enable users to easily create 3D interactive contents. He is constantly thinking about this fascinating question: how do we shape the languages (programming languages, body languages, natural languages, etc.) that people will use to customize and communicate with the holograms in the future? Previously, he was an undergraduate in the School of Software at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). He was a research member at the [Digital ART Lab](http://dalab.se.sjtu.edu.cn/www/home/), supervised by [Prof. Xubo Yang](http://dalab.se.sjtu.edu.cn/www/home/?page_id=143) and Prof. Shuangjiu Xiao.
