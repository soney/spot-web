However, ultra-small computing platforms like the Sony  SmartWatch and Apple  iPod Nano lack a means of text entry. This limits their potential, despite the fact they are capable computers. In this work, we present a soft keyboard  interaction technique called ZoomBoard that enables text entry on ultra-small devices. Our approach uses  iterative  zooming  to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comfortable size. We based our design on a QWERTY layout, so that it is immediately familiar to users and leverages existing skill. As the ultimate test, we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16x6mm–smaller than a US penny. After eight practice trials, users achieved an average of 9.3 words per minute, with accuracy comparable to a full-sized physical keyboard. This compares favorably to existing mobile text input methods.","award":"honorable_mention","award_description":"","submission_status":null,"pdf":{"id":"c0f21a13-c0a4-502a-838f-c2a321142667","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/2406afe7976a760c93ea004ceaeb9def/zoomboard_3f3a88ede1.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"f6d2f765-8ee4-5ca3-940e-a90f46ea4880","given_name":"Chris","family_name":"Harrison","homepage":"http://www.chrisharrison.net/"},{"id":"35881aa1-9c71-5d3d-9181-f26cb5e858e4","given_name":"Amy","family_name":"Ogan","homepage":"http://amyogan.com/"},{"id":"d44e0680-0f10-53af-a876-f39782982142","given_name":"Jason","family_name":"Wiese","homepage":"http://jasonwiese.net/"}],"venue":{"id":"0211ccdd-b91f-5df8-9743-d784c47c9063","year":2013,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2013","homepage":"http://chi2013.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1037fe42-d0e6-5cbd-a633-964ed6e92745"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
