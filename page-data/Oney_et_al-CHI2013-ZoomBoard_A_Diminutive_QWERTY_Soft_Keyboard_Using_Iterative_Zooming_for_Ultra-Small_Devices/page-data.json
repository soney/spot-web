However, ultra-small computing platforms like the Sony  SmartWatch and Apple  iPod Nano lack a means of text entry. This limits their potential, despite the fact they are capable computers. In this work, we present a soft keyboard  interaction technique called ZoomBoard that enables text entry on ultra-small devices. Our approach uses  iterative  zooming  to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comfortable size. We based our design on a QWERTY layout, so that it is immediately familiar to users and leverages existing skill. As the ultimate test, we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16x6mm–smaller than a US penny. After eight practice trials, users achieved an average of 9.3 words per minute, with accuracy comparable to a full-sized physical keyboard. This compares favorably to existing mobile text input methods.","award":"honorable_mention","pdf":{"id":"/home/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/45e116dcaf2278f8bef72b5362198d06.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/2406afe7976a760c93ea004ceaeb9def/45e116dcaf2278f8bef72b5362198d06.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"http://from.so/"},{"id":22,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Chris","family_name":"Harrison","homepage":"http://www.chrisharrison.net/"},{"id":23,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Amy","family_name":"Ogan","homepage":"http://amyogan.com/"},{"id":24,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Jason","family_name":"Wiese","homepage":"http://jasonwiese.net/"}],"venue":{"id":5,"year":2013,"short_name":"CHI","homepage":"http://chi2013.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_7"}}}
