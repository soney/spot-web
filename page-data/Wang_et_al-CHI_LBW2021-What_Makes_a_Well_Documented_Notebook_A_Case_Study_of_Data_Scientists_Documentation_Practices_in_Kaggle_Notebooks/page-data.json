A Case Study of Data Scientists' Documentation Practices in Kaggle Notebooks","abstract":"Many data scientists use computational notebooks to test and present their works, as the notebook can weave code and documentation together (computational narrative), and it supports the rapid iteration of code experiments. However, it is not easy to write good documentation in a data science notebook, partially because there lacks a corpus of well-documented notebooks as exemplars for data scientists to follow. To cope with this challenge, this work looks at Kaggle -- a large online community for data scientists to host and participate in machine learning competitions --- and considers highly-voted Kaggle notebooks as a proxy to the well-documented notebooks. Through a qualitative analysis at both the notebook level and the markdown-cell level, we find these notebooks are indeed well documented in reference to previous literature. Also, the analysis reveals nine categories of contents that data scientists write in their documentation cells, and these documentation cells often interplay with different stages of the data science lifecycle.\nWe conclude the paper with design implications and future research directions.","award":"none","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":null,"authors":[{"id":88,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Dakuo","family_name":"Wang","homepage":"https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=ibm-Dakuo.Wang"},{"id":86,"membership":"ugrad_ms_student","given_name":"Ruidong","family_name":"Liu","homepage":null},{"id":91,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Soya","family_name":"Park","homepage":null},{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":42,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Christopher","family_name":"Brooks","homepage":"http://christopherbrooks.ca/"},{"id":4,"membership":"member","given_name":"April","family_name":"Wang","homepage":"https://aprilwang.me/"},{"id":89,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Jaimie","family_name":"Drozdal","homepage":null}],"venue":{"id":39,"year":2021,"short_name":"CHI LBW","homepage":"https://chi2021.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_45"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
