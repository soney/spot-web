Her research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, and Programming. She is interested in lowering the barriers to programming and education for people with visual impairments by understanding their experiences through qualitative research methods. Before starting her PhD, Mauli was in the MS program (2018) at the University of Michigan School of Information. During her MS, she also worked closely with [Matthew Kay](http://www.mjskay.com/), [Michael Nebeling](http://www.michael-nebeling.de/), and [Sun Young Park](http://sunyoungpark.weebly.com/). For her undergraduate studies, she attended the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/) (Design and Electronics, 2014), and was advised by [Pradeep Yammiyavar](https://www.iitg.ac.in/design/portfolio/py/Prof.%20Pradeep%20Gururaj%20Yammiyavar%20_%20Department%20of%20Design.html).
