These forms of interaction are increasingly popular as developer trends have moved from static, linearly structured pages to dynamic, interactive pages. However, they are also often in-accessible to blind web users who tend to rely on keyboard-based screen readers to navigate the web. Despite existing web accessibility standards, engineering web pages to be equally accessible via both keyboard and visuomotor mouse-based interactions is often not a priority for developers. Improving access to this kind of visual, interactive web content has been a long-standing goal of HCI researchers, but the obstacles have exceeded the many proposed solutions:  promoting developer best practices, automatically generating accessible versions of existing web pages, and sighted-guides, such as screen and cursor-sharing, which tend to diminish the end user’s agency and privacy. In this paper, we present a collaborative approach to helping blind web users overcome inaccessible parts of existing web pages. We introduce Arboretum, a new architecture that enables any web user to seamlessly hand off controlled parts of their browsing session to remote users, while maintaining control over the interface via a “propose and accept/reject” mechanism. We illustrate the benefit of Arboretum by using it to implement Arbility, a browser that allows blind users to hand off targeted visual interaction tasks to remote crowd workers without forfeiting agency. We evaluate the entire system in a study with nine blind web users, showing that Arbility allows blind users to access web content that was previously inaccessible via a screen reader alone.","award":null,"award_description":null,"pdf":{"id":"C:/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/7a7b0cc9cf6b8a5a0e41e562cffabb0d.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/28c17f25693fe9a7011e53fd1e375b91/7a7b0cc9cf6b8a5a0e41e562cffabb0d.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":40,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Alan","family_name":"Lundgard","homepage":"https://www.alanlundgard.com/"},{"id":7,"membership":"member","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":41,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Michael","family_name":"Nebeling","homepage":"http://michael-nebeling.de/"},{"id":26,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wlasecki/"}],"venue":{"id":10,"year":2018,"short_name":"UIST","homepage":"http://uist.acm.org/uist2018/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_14"}}}
