These forms of interaction are increasingly popular as developer trends have moved from static, linearly structured pages to dynamic, interactive pages. However, they are also often in-accessible to blind web users who tend to rely on keyboard-based screen readers to navigate the web. Despite existing web accessibility standards, engineering web pages to be equally accessible via both keyboard and visuomotor mouse-based interactions is often not a priority for developers. Improving access to this kind of visual, interactive web content has been a long-standing goal of HCI researchers, but the obstacles have exceeded the many proposed solutions:  promoting developer best practices, automatically generating accessible versions of existing web pages, and sighted-guides, such as screen and cursor-sharing, which tend to diminish the end user’s agency and privacy. In this paper, we present a collaborative approach to helping blind web users overcome inaccessible parts of existing web pages. We introduce Arboretum, a new architecture that enables any web user to seamlessly hand off controlled parts of their browsing session to remote users, while maintaining control over the interface via a “propose and accept/reject” mechanism. We illustrate the benefit of Arboretum by using it to implement Arbility, a browser that allows blind users to hand off targeted visual interaction tasks to remote crowd workers without forfeiting agency. We evaluate the entire system in a study with nine blind web users, showing that Arbility allows blind users to access web content that was previously inaccessible via a screen reader alone.","award":"none","award_description":"","status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"4674a1ad-bf44-55f5-a67c-3d38134c991c","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/28c17f25693fe9a7011e53fd1e375b91/arboretum_0d6ad1cca7.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"531f7692-0f4f-5c61-acda-4640ce28e08a","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"e5ae8465-b31f-5dd0-bc5e-9bb064748281","given_name":"Alan","family_name":"Lundgard","homepage":"https://www.alanlundgard.com/"},{"id":"0161c1fe-c72e-53bb-b025-f05eac138de8","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"fef786db-eaf5-5404-81e2-942b17010a89","given_name":"Michael","family_name":"Nebeling","homepage":"http://michael-nebeling.de/"},{"id":"5ef7fa74-804c-5915-bd8b-6771f8bca976","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":null}],"venue":{"id":"71673e02-35a9-5be7-908e-8accd6d1bbd7","year":2018,"short_name":"UIST","name_year":"UIST 2018","homepage":"http://uist.acm.org/uist2018/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"258219f1-af4d-582f-8f89-ba9c0a8b870b"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
