These forms of interaction are increasingly popular as developer trends have moved from static, linearly structured pages to dynamic, interactive pages. However, they are also often in-accessible to blind web users who tend to rely on keyboard-based screen readers to navigate the web. Despite existing web accessibility standards, engineering web pages to be equally accessible via both keyboard and visuomotor mouse-based interactions is often not a priority for developers. Improving access to this kind of visual, interactive web content has been a long-standing goal of HCI researchers, but the obstacles have exceeded the many proposed solutions:  promoting developer best practices, automatically generating accessible versions of existing web pages, and sighted-guides, such as screen and cursor-sharing, which tend to diminish the end user’s agency and privacy. In this paper, we present a collaborative approach to helping blind web users overcome inaccessible parts of existing web pages. We introduce Arboretum, a new architecture that enables any web user to seamlessly hand off controlled parts of their browsing session to remote users, while maintaining control over the interface via a “propose and accept/reject” mechanism. We illustrate the benefit of Arboretum by using it to implement Arbility, a browser that allows blind users to hand off targeted visual interaction tasks to remote crowd workers without forfeiting agency. We evaluate the entire system in a study with nine blind web users, showing that Arbility allows blind users to access web content that was previously inaccessible via a screen reader alone.","award":"none","award_description":"","submission_status":null,"pdf":{"id":"4674a1ad-bf44-55f5-a67c-3d38134c991c","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/28c17f25693fe9a7011e53fd1e375b91/arboretum_0d6ad1cca7.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":"48391437-bf72-594b-a861-bd3f03d271f7","given_name":"Alan","family_name":"Lundgard","homepage":"https://www.alanlundgard.com/"},{"id":"e34d1866-1a37-5003-b4d8-a2f73434dc57","given_name":"Rebecca","family_name":"Krosnick","homepage":"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rkros/"},{"id":"9ff144fe-728f-5433-a6ff-d07ce201e5f9","given_name":"Michael","family_name":"Nebeling","homepage":"http://michael-nebeling.de/"},{"id":"57ac47d8-890d-5661-b094-451acd78c740","given_name":"Walter","family_name":"Lasecki","homepage":null}],"venue":{"id":"c330f1e7-8e1f-5618-aa49-b8e8bc33f518","year":2018,"short_name":"UIST","name_year":"UIST 2018","homepage":"http://uist.acm.org/uist2018/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f23be5f4-6b46-55d7-8b85-ec72a95833e4"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
