However, as we found in interviews with programming instructors, monitoring students' progress during exercises is difficult, particularly for large classes. We present VizProg, a system that allows instructors to monitor and inspect students' coding progress in real-time during in-class exercises. VizProg represents students' statuses as a 2D Euclidean spatial map that encodes the students' problem-solving approaches and progress in real-time. VizProg allows instructors to navigate the temporal and structural evolution of students' code, understand relationships between code, and determine when to provide feedback. A comparison experiment showed that VizProg helped to identify more students' problems than a baseline system. VizProg also provides richer and more comprehensive information for identifying important student behavior. By managing students' activities at scale, this work presents a new paradigm for improving the quality of live learning.","award":"honorable_mention","award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"d2ea6a7c-3f8c-5b22-9bd2-c02998f9ad9e","localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/fb597834d009e60f5994b0991c6d533d/chi23b_sub1516_cam_i16_6c90ec9599.pdf"}},"authors":[{"id":"68b63621-df9d-5cb0-aba2-16d3d65db66a","given_name":"Ashley","family_name":"Zhang","homepage":"https://gezhangrp.com/"},{"id":"0ccf1926-eee7-5584-8c00-a9bb8c4498b9","given_name":"Yan","family_name":"Chen","homepage":"https://chensivan.github.io/"},{"id":"6a00c998-7af3-5fc9-94f7-a2adcc17b410","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"}],"venue":{"id":"1faf9c2c-d190-5fe4-88c0-1e4e353afb63","year":2023,"short_name":"CHI","name_year":"CHI 2023","homepage":"https://chi2023.acm.org/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c7d7bdb-f881-5a65-a172-8751e8941793"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
