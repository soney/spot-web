FireCrystal is a new Firefox extension that allows developers to indicate interactive  behaviors of interest, and shows the specific code (Javascript, CSS, and HTML) that is responsible for those behaviors. FireCrystal  provides an execution timeline that  users can scrub back and forth, and the ability to select items of interest in the actual web page UI to see the associated code. FireCrystal may be especially useful for developers who are trying to learn the implementation details of interactive behaviors, so they can reuse these behaviors in their own web site.","award":null,"award_description":null,"status":"accepted","pdf":{"id":"/Users/soney/code/spot-web/.cache/gatsby-source-filesystem/cfa889befbbe4588f9f630b0125b8da4.pdf absPath of file","publicURL":"/static/a37fe7ff6922368401916f859444901d/cfa889befbbe4588f9f630b0125b8da4.pdf"},"authors":[{"id":1,"membership":"lead","given_name":"Steve","family_name":"Oney","homepage":"https://from.so/Steve_Oney"},{"id":9,"membership":"collaborator","given_name":"Brad","family_name":"Myers","homepage":"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/"}],"venue":{"id":1,"year":2009,"short_name":"VL/HCC","homepage":"https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/vlhcc09/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"Publication_1"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
