She studies human-computer interaction and is generally interested in end-user programming, making it easier for non-experts to create computer programs. Currently she is exploring programming by demonstration and crowdsourcing techniques for building dynamic user interfaces. Previously she worked as a software engineer at MathWorks. Rebecca received her SB and MEng in Computer Science from MIT, where she was advised by Professor Rob Miller.
