She is generally interested in designing end-user programming systems. She currently is exploring ways to make creating and editing web macros more intuitive and visual, and less script-heavy. She has also designed programming-by-demonstration systems for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces. Previously she worked as a software engineer at MathWorks. Rebecca received her SB and MEng in Computer Science from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), where she was advised by [Professor Rob Miller](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/rob-miller).
