          abstract: >-
            Multi-stage programming tutorials are key learning resources for programmers, using progressive incremental
            steps to teach them how to build larger software systems. A good multi-stage tutorial describes the code
            clearly, explains the rationale and code changes for each step, and allows readers to experiment as they
            work through the tutorial. In practice, it is time-consuming for authors to create tutorials with these
            attributes. In this paper, we introduce Colaroid, an interactive authoring tool for creating high quality
            multi-stage tutorials. Colaroid tutorials are augmented computational notebooks, where snippets and outputs
            represent a snapshot of a project, with source code differences highlighted, complete source code context
            for each snippet, and the ability to load and tinker with any stage of the project in a linked IDE. In two
            laboratory studies, we found Colaroid makes it easy to create multi-stage tutorials, while offering
            advantages to readers compared to video and web-based tutorials.

            about a large code sample. Developers can write their code in the IDE and as they are writing their code,
            Colaroid allows them to divide their work into steps. Colaroid tutorials are augmented computational
            notebooks, where snippets and outputs represent a snapshot of a project, with source code differences

          abstract: >-
            Programming instructors often conduct in-class exercises to help them identify students that are falling
            behind and surface students' misconceptions. However, as we found in interviews with programming
            instructors, monitoring students' progress during exercises is difficult, particularly for large classes. We
            present VizProg, a system that allows instructors to monitor and inspect students' coding progress in
            real-time during in-class exercises. VizProg represents students' statuses as a 2D Euclidean spatial map
            that encodes the students' problem-solving approaches and progress in real-time. VizProg allows instructors
            to navigate the temporal and structural evolution of students' code, understand relationships between code,
            and determine when to provide feedback. A comparison experiment showed that VizProg helped to identify more
            students' problems than a baseline system. VizProg also provides richer and more comprehensive information
            for identifying important student behavior. By managing students' activities at scale, this work presents a
            new paradigm for improving the quality of live learning.
          short_description: >-
            VizProg is a tool that allows instructors of large programming classes to monitor students' progress at
            scale. It represents students' code in a 2D map where dots representing students move further to the right
            as they get closer to a correct solution. VizProg uses vertical space to represent different approaches to
            solving the problem (so students towards the bottom of the map are using a different approach than students
            at the top of the map).

          abstract: ' Immersive authoring tools allow users to intuitively create and manipulate 3D scenes while immersed in Virtual Reality (VR). Collaboratively designing these scenes is a creative process that involves numerous edits, explorations of design alternatives, and frequent communication with collaborators. Version Control Systems (VCSs) help users achieve this by keeping track of the version history and creating a shared hub for communication. However, most VCSs are unsuitable for managing the version history of VR content because their underlying line differencing mechanism is designed for text and lacks the semantic information of 3D content; and the widely adopted commit model is designed for asynchronous collaboration rather than real-time awareness and communication in VR. We introduce VRGit, a new collaborative VCS that visualizes version history as a directed graph composed of 3D miniatures, and enables users to easily navigate versions, create branches, as well as preview and reuse versions directly in VR. Beyond individual uses, VRGit also facilitates synchronous collaboration in VR by providing awareness of users’ activities and version history through portals and shared history visualizations. In a lab study with 14 participants (seven groups), we demonstrate that VRGit enables users to easily manage version history both individually and collaboratively in VR.'

          abstract: >-
            Peer learning, as a form of collaborative learning, has been widely used in programming courses as a means
            of promoting active learning and enhancing students' programming skills. However, it is challenging for
            instructors to group students effectively so that they can have fruitful conversations. We conducted a study
            with 15 students from an introductory programming course to investigate whether and how grouping students
            with similar or different solutions affects the discussions that take place within groups. The findings
            indicate that pairing students by the similarity of their code might influence students' learning and coding
            skills. Specifically, students who were paired with people that had different solutions had, on average,
            more engaging conversations and were more likely to write more diverse solutions in the future. The results
            also highlight the need for tools to facilitate the pairing process in programming courses in order to
            optimize the learning outcomes for students.

            users, offering the possibility of automating computer tasks. One candidate task is web scraping. We
            informally experimented with ChatGPT to explore the potential promises and pitfalls of using it for scraping
            data from web user interfaces. We share our observations and considerations for future human-LLM web
            scraping systems.

          title: "\tRunEx: Augmenting Regular-Expression Code Search with Runtime Values"
          abstract: >-
            Programming instructors frequently use in-class exercises to help students reinforce concepts learned in
            lecture. However, identifying class-wide patterns and mistakes in students' code can be challenging,
            especially for large classes. Conventional code search tools are insufficient for this purpose as they are
            not designed for finding semantic structures underlying large students' code corpus, where the code samples
            are similar, relatively small, and written by novice programmers. To address this limitation, we introduce
            RunEx, a novel code search tool where instructors can effortlessly generate queries with minimal prior
            knowledge of code search and rapidly search through a large code corpus. The tool consists of two parts: 1)
            a syntax that augments regular expressions with runtime values, and 2) a user interface that enables
            instructors to construct runtime and syntax-based queries with high expressiveness and apply combined
            filters to code examples. Our comparison experiment shows that RunEx outperforms baseline systems with text
            matching alone in identifying code patterns with higher accuracy. Furthermore, RunEx features a user
            interface that requires minimal prior knowledge to create search queries. Through searching and analyzing
            students' code with runtime values at scale, our work introduces a new paradigm for understanding patterns
            and errors in programming education.
          short_description: >-
            A system that improves code search by augmenting regular expressions with the ability to specify constraints
            on runtime values of specific expressions.

          title: 'CFlow: Supporting Semantic Flow Analysis of Students'' Code in Programming Problems at Scale'
          abstract: >-
            The high demand for computer science education has led to high enrollments, with thousands of students in
            many introductory courses. In such large courses, it can be overwhelmingly difficult for instructors to
            understand class-wide problem-solving patterns or issues, which is crucial for improving instruction and
            addressing important pedagogical challenges. In this paper, we propose a technique and system, *CFlow*, for
            creating understandable and navigable representations of code at scale. CFlow is able to represent thousands
            of code samples in a visualization that resembles a single code sample. CFlow creates scalable code
            representations by (1) clustering individual statements with similar semantic purposes, (2) presenting
            clustered statements in a way that maintains semantic relationships between statements, (3) representing the
            correctness of different variations as a histogram, and (4) allowing users to navigate through solutions
            interactively using semantic filters. With a multi-level view design, users can navigate high-level
            patterns, and low-level implementations. This is in contrast to prior tools that either limit their focus on
            isolated statements (and thus discard the surrounding context of those statements) or cluster entire code
            samples (which can lead to large numbers of clusters---for example, if there are *n* code features and *m*
            implementations of each, there can be m^n clusters). We evaluated the effectiveness of CFlow with a
            comparison study, found participants using CFlow spent only half the time identifying mistakes and recalled
            twice as many desired patterns from over 6,000 submissions.
          short_description: >-
            Introduces CFlow, a system for visualizing and analyzing large numbers of student code submissions to help
            instructors understand common mistakes and patterns. CFlow uses semantic labeling and code structure
            analysis to cluster code lines across submissions and present them in a visualization that resembles a
            single code sample, allowing instructors to see the overall semantic flow while still being able to dive
            into individual submissions.

          abstract: >-
            Code readability is crucial for program comprehension, maintenance, and collaboration. However, many of the
            standards for writing readable code are derived from sighted developers' readability needs. We conducted a
            qualitative study with 16 blind and visually impaired (BVI) developers to better understand their
            readability preferences for common code formatting rules such as identifier naming conventions, line length,
            and use of indentation. Our findings revealed how BVI developers' preferences contrast with those of sighted
            developers and how we can expand the existing rules to improve code readability on screen readers. Based on
            the findings, we contribute an inclusive understanding of code readability and derive implications for
            programming languages, development environments, and style guides. Our work helps broaden the meaning of
            readable code in software engineering and accessibility research.
